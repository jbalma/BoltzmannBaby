Number 1 
is like a stick 
A straight line down 
that's very quick! 
 
For number 2 
go right around 
Then make a line 
across the ground! 
 
Go right around 
What will it be? 
Go round again 
to make a 3! 
 
Down and over 
and down some more 
That's the way

First a ball and then a line, 
That's the way to make a 9. 
 
Tall straight, circle then, 
That's the way to make a 10 
 
One, two, three, four five! 
Once I caught a fish alive; 
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 
Then I let it go again.

Which finger did it bite? 
This little finger on my right.

If you are an even number 
You always have a pair 
So if you look around 
Your buddy will always be there 
But ... 
If you are an odd number 
There's always a lonely one 
He looks around to find his buddy 
But he's the only one.

Being even is just great.

Being odd is just fine.

Be glad your nose is on your face,  
not pasted on some other place,  
for if it were where it is not,  
you might dislike your nose a lot.  
  
Imagine if your precious nose  
were sandwiched in between your toes,  
that clearly would not be a treat,  
for you’d be forced to smell your feet.  
  
Your nose would be a source of dread  
were it attached atop your head,  
it soon would drive you to despair,  
forever tickled by your hair.  
  
Within your ear, your nose would be  
an absolute catastrophe,  
for when you were obliged to sneeze,  
your brain would rattle from the breeze.  
  
Your nose, instead, through thick and thin,  
remains between your eyes and chin,  
not pasted on some other place--  
be glad your nose is on your face!  
  
How doth the little crocodile  
     Improve his shining tail,  
And pour the waters of the Nile  
     On every golden scale!  
  
How cheerfully he seems to grin,  
     How neatly spreads his claws,  
And welcomes little fishes in,  
     With gently smiling jaws!  
  
Synonyms almost the same,  
Synonyms almost the same,  
Come, let’s play a matching game.  
Sing two words that mean the same.  
  
(alternate following lines teacher with  
students or boys with girls)  
  
When I’m happy,  
I am glad.  
When I’m naughty,  
I am bad.  
If it’s large,  
It’s also big.  
A hog is  
Also called a pig.  
  
See me hurry,  
See me rush.  
To be quiet  
Means to hush.  
If I want,  
I also wish.  
A plastic bowl  
Is still a dish.  
  
Practice or  
Repeat a song.  
If you miss,  
You go far wrong.  
If you end,  
You stop the game.  
They have like meanings,  
Much the same.  
  
Synonyms, almost the same.  
Synonyms, almost the same.  
  
I'm the first word; don't change me!  
Don't change me, don't change me.  
I'm the first word; don't change me!  
Oh, no, just let me be.  
  
When you change the second word,  
Second word, second word,  
When you change the second word,  
A shorter word you'll see.  
  
Certain letters are taken out,  
Taken out, taken out.  
Certain letters are taken out.  
One word will remain.  
  
Apostrophe will fill that space,  
Fill that space, fill that space.  
Apostrophe will fill that space,  
The rest will stay the same.  
  
Can't and couldn't, isn't, too.  
Isn't, too, isn't, too,  
Won't and I've and let's, it's true,  
Contractions every one.  
  
I'm and she's and you're and he'd,  
You're and he'd, you're and he'd,  
Wouldn't, didn't, we'll and she'd,  
Good! And now we're done.  
  
The period is a busy man.  
A small round traffic cop.  
He blocks the helter-skelter words  
And brings them to a stop.  
  
The question mark's a tiny girl,  
She's small but very wise;  
She asks too many questions  
For a person of her size.  
  
Of all the punctuation folk,  
I like the comma best.  
For when I'm getting out of breath  
He lets me take a rest.  
  
Quotation marks are curious.  
When friendly talk begins  
You'll always find these little marks  
Are busy listening in.  
 
The Big Hand is busy 
But the Small Hand has power. 
The large one counts the minutes. 
But the Little One names the hour. 
 
When both Hands stand at the top together, 
It's sure to be Twelve O'clock. But whether 
That's twelve at noon or twelve at night 
Depends on if it's dark or light. 
 
The hands on the clock go round and round, 
Round and round, round and round. 
The hands on the clock go round and round. 
To tell us the time. 
 
The short hand on the clock 
Goes from number to number, 
Number to number, number to number. 
The short hand on the clock 
Goes from number to number. 
To tell us the time. 
 
The long hand on the clock 
Goes around by fives, 
Around by fives, around by fives. 
The long hand on the clock 
Goes around by fives. 
To tell us the minutes. 
 
HIckory Dickory Dock, 
The mouse ran up the clock; 
The clock struck One, 
The mouse ran down, 
Hickory Dickory Dock! 
 
Hickory Dickory Dock, 
The mouse ran up the clock; 
The clock struck Two, 
The mouse said BOO! 
Hickory Dickory Dock! 
 
Hickory Dickory Dock, 
The mouse ran up the clock; 
The clock struck Three, 
The mouse said Wheeeee... 
As he slid down the clock! 
 
I'm in the clock crew and I'm okay! 
I tick all night and I tick all day. 
 
I've got two hands, I'm having a ball, 
Because I've got no arms at all! 
 
My big hand can move sixty minutes in one hour, 
I'm the one with the strength and power. 
 
My small hand isn't quite as fast. 
If they were in a race, it would come last! 
 
It takes so long just to get around (12 hours you know), 
It's careful, small, and slow. 
 
Now meet my friends that help me tick-tock, 
Half past, quarter past, quarter to and o'clock. 
  
The exclamation mark's an elf,  
Who is easily excited.  
When children laugh or cry or scream  
It's then he's most delighted.  
  
A sentence, sentence, sentence  
Is complete, complete, complete  
When 5 simple rules it meets, meets, meets.  
It has a subject, subject,  
And a verb, verb, verb.  
It makes sense, sense, sense  
With every word, word, word.  
Add a capital letter and end mark, mark,  
Now our sentence has all its parts.  
  
If you are wise  
You will organize  
You handwriting always  
To be the right size.  
The shape is important  
Round and neat  
Using your hands  
Not your feet.  
  
Keep the right pace  
You're not in a race  
Or your poor little word  
Will fall on its face.  
Be careful of your spacing  
Because like racing,  
If you don't heed it  
You won't be able  
To read it!

The hat was very tight,  
And it made the lady frown.  
  
I saw an elephant  
Standing on same hay.  
Its ear looked like a C,

It had long, skinny legs,

Four bright coins shining at me,  
The first one said, "I'm a penny you see."  
The second one said, "How do you do?  
I'm called a nickel, and I'm bigger than you!"  
The third one said, "You're both small stuff,  
If you want to buy something, you're not enough!  
But look at me, I'm small, and I shine,  
I can buy something cuz I'm a dime."  
The last coin looked at them all and laughed,  
"All of you together don't measure up to me,  
Cuz I'm a quarter, can't you see?"  
  
Penny, penny,

One thin dime.  
Makes twenty-five cents  
Every time.  
  
Five fat nickels,  
No thin dimes.  
Makes twenty-five cents  
Any time.  
  
1 cent is a penny,  
10 cents is a dime,

Now you know that I'm

Don't forget the quarter,  
It's worth 25 cents!

See the shiny penny, brown as it can be,  
With two maple leaves for all of us to see.  
It's made out of copper at a mint,  
A penny's worth one whole cent.  
  
A resting beaver will be found  
On a nickel, shiny, smooth, and round.  
The Queen is on the other side.  
A nickel is worth five cents. Say it with pride.  
  
A dime is the smallest coin of them all,  
With the Bluenose sailing nice and tall.  
A dime is worth ten cents. Don't you agree?  
Which makes me happy as can be!  
  
When compared to other coins,  
A loonie is gold and shiny,  
  
It's worth a dollar at the store,  
But isn't very tiny,  
  
Used by people in Canada,  
To buy things big and small,  
  
The real loon floats on a lake,  
Listen close and hear it call!  
  
  
How good to lie a little while  
And look up through the tree!  
The Sky is like a kind big smile  
Bent sweetly over me.  
  
The Sunshine flickers through the lace  
Of leaves above my head,  
And kisses me upon the face  
Like Mother, before bed.  
  
The Wind comes stealing o'er the grass  
To whisper pretty things;  
And though I cannot see him pass,  
I feel his careful wings.  
  
So many gentle Friends are near  
Whom one can scarcely see,  
A child should never feel a fear,  
Wherever he may be.  
  
The lightning and thunder  
They go and come;  
But the stars and the stillness  
Are always at home.  
  
These are my two drops of rain  
Waiting on the window-pane.  
  
I am waiting here to see  
Which the winning one will be.  
  
Both of them have different names.  
One is John and one is James.  
  
All the best and all the worst  
Comes from which of them is first.  
  
James has just begun to ooze.  
He's the one I want to lose.  
  
John is waiting to begin.  
He's the one I want to win.  
  
James is going slowly on.  
Something sort of sticks to John.  
  
John is moving off at last.  
James is going pretty fast.  
  
John is rushing down the pane.  
James is going slow again.  
  
James has met a sort of smear.  
John is getting very near.  
  
Is he going fast enough?  
(James has found a piece of fluff.)  
  
John has quickly hurried by.  
(James was talking to a fly.)  
  
John is there, and John has won!  
Look! I told you! Here's the sun!  
  
Halfway down the stairs  
Is a stair  
Where I sit.  
There isn't any  
Other stair  
Quite like  
It.  
I'm not at the bottom,  
I'm not at the top;  
So this is the stair  
Where  
I always  
Stop.  
  
Halfway up the stairs  
Isn't up  
And it isn't down.  
It isn't in the nursery,  
It isn't in town.  
And all sorts of funny thoughts  
Run round my head.  
It isn't really  
Anywhere!  
It's somewhere else  
Instead!  
  
  
No one can tell me,  
Nobody knows,  
Where the wind comes from,  
Where the wind goes.  
  
It's flying from somewhere  
As fast as it can,  
I couldn't keep up with it,  
Not if I ran.  
  
But if I stopped holding  
The string of my kite,  
It would blow with the wind  
For a day and a night.  
  
And then when I found it,  
Wherever it blew,  
I should know that the wind  
Had been going there too.  
  
So then I could tell them  
Where the wind goes…  
But where the wind comes from  
Nobody knows.  
  
  
  
  
Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,  
God grant me grace my prayers to say:  
O God! preserve my mother dear  
In strength and health for many a year;  
And, O! preserve my father too,  
And may I pay him reverence due;  
And may I my best thoughts employ  
To be my parents' hope and joy;  
And O! preserve my brothers both  
From evil doings and from sloth,  
And may we always love each other  
Our friends, our father, and our mother:  
And still, O Lord, to me impart  
An innocent and grateful heart,  
That after my great sleep I may  
Awake to thy eternal day! Amen  
  
There was a little guinea pig,  
Who being little, was not big;  
He always walked upon his feet,  
And never fasted when he eat.  
  
When from a place he run away,  
He never at the place did stay;  
And while he run, as I am told,  
He never stood still for young or old.  
  
He often squeaked, and sometimes violent,  
And when he squeaked he never was silent.  
Though never instructed by a cat,  
He knew a mouse was not a rat.  
  
One day, as I am certified,  
He took a whim, and fairly died;  
And as I am told by men of sense,  
He never has been living since.  
  
A Light exists in Spring  
Not present on the Year  
At any other period --  
When March is scarcely here  
  
A Color stands abroad  
On Solitary Fields  
That Science cannot overtake  
But Human Nature feels.  
  
It waits upon the Lawn,  
It shows the furthest Tree  
Upon the furthest Slope you know  
It almost speaks to you.  
  
Then as Horizons step  
Or Noons report away  
Without the Formula of sound  
It passes and we stay --  
  
A quality of loss  
Affecting our Content  
As Trade had suddenly encroached  
Upon a Sacrament.  
  
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree  
Toward heaven still,  
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill  
Beside it, and there may be two or three  
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.  
But I am done with apple-picking now.  
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,  
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.  
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight  
I got from looking through a pane of glass  
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough  
And held against the world of hoary grass.  
It melted, and I let it fall and break.  
But I was well  
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,  
And I could tell  
What form my dreaming was about to take.  
Magnified apples appear and disappear,  
Stem end and blossom end,  
And every fleck of russet showing clear.  
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,  
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.  
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.  
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin  
The rumbling sound  
Of load on load of apples coming in.  
For I have had too much  
Of apple-picking: I am overtired  
Of the great harvest I myself desired.  
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,  
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.  
For all  
That struck the earth,  
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,  
Went surely to the cider-apple heap  
As of no worth.  
One can see what will trouble  
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.  
Were he not gone,  
The woodchuck could say whether it's like his  
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,  
Or just some human sleep.  
  
  
  
  
I heard the wagons rumbling past the garden fence, sometimes I even saw them through gently swaying gaps in the foliage. How the wood of their spokes and shafts creaked in the summer heat! Laborers were coming from the fields and laughing so that it was a scandal.  
  
I was sitting on our little swing, just resting among the trees in my parents' garden.  
  
On the other side of the fence the traffic never stopped. Children's running feet were past in a moment; harvest wagons with men and women perched on and around the sheaves darkened the flower beds; toward evening I saw a gentleman slowly promenading with a walking stick, and a couple of girls who met him arm in arm stepped aside into the grass as they greeted him.  
  
Then birds flew up as if in showers, I followed them with my eyes and saw how high they soared in one breath, till I felt not that they were rising but that I was falling, and holding fast to the ropes began to swing a little out of sheer weakness. Soon I was swinging more strongly as the air blew colder and instead of soaring birds trembling stars appeared.  
  
I was given my supper by candlelight. Often both my arms were on the wooden board and I was already weary as I bit into my bread and butter. The coarse-mesh window curtains bellied in the warm wind and many a time some passer-by outside would stay them with his hands as if he wanted to see me better and speak to me. Usually the candle soon went out and in the sooty candle smoke the assembled midges went on circling for a while. If anyone asked me a question from the window I would gaze at him as if at a distant mountain or into vacancy, nor did he particularly care whether he got an answer or not. But if one jumped over the window sill and announced that the others were already waiting, then I did get to my feet with a sigh.  
  
'What are you sighing for? What's wrong? Has something dreadful happened that can never be made good? Shan't we ever recover from it? Is everything lost?'  
  
Nothing was lost. We ran to the front of the house. 'Thank God, here you are at last!' -'You're always late!' -'Why just me?' -'Especially you, why don't you stay at home if you don't want to come.' -'No quarter!' -'No quarter? What kind of way is that to talk?'  
  
We ran our heads full tilt into the evening. There was no daytime and no nighttime. Now our waistcoat buttons would be clacking together like teeth, again we would be keeping a steady distance from each other as we ran, breathing fire like wild beasts in the tropics. Like cuirassiers in old wars, stamping and springing high, we drove each other down the short alley and with this impetus in our legs a farther stretch along the main road. Stray figures went into the ditch, hardly had they vanished down the dusky escarpment when they were standing like newcomers on the field path above and looking down.  
  
'Come on down!' -'Come on up first!' -'So's you can push us down, no thanks, we're not such fools.' -'You're afraid, you mean. Come on up, you cowards!' -'Afraid? Of the likes of you? You're going to push us down, are you? That's a good one.'  
  
We made the attempt and were pushed head over heels into the grass of the roadside ditch, tumbling of our own free will. Everything was equally warm to us, we felt neither warmth nor chill in the grass, only one got tired.  
  
Turning on one's right side, with a hand under the ear, one could easily have fallen asleep there. But one wanted to get up again with chin uplifted, only to roll into a deeper ditch. Then with an arm thrust out crosswise and legs threshing to the side one thought to launch into the air again only to fall for certain into a still deeper ditch. And of this one never wanted to make an end.  
  
How one might stretch oneself out, especially in the knees, properly to sleep in the last ditch, was something scarcely thought of, and one simply lay on one's back, like an invalid, inclined to weep a little. One blinked as now and then a youngster with elbows pressed to his sides sprang over one's head with dark-looming soles, in a leap from the escarpment to the roadway.  
  
The moon was already some way up in the sky, in its light a mail coach drove past. A small wind began to blow everywhere, even in the ditch one could feel it, and nearby the forest began to rustle. Then one was no longer so anxious to be alone.  
  
'Where are you?' - 'Come here!' - 'All together!' -'What are you hiding for, drop your nonsense!' -'Don't you know the mail's gone past already?' -'Not already?' -'Of course; it went past while you were sleeping.' -'I wasn't sleeping. What an idea!' -'Oh shut up, you're still half asleep.' -'But I wasn't.' - 'Come on!'  
  
We ran bunched more closely together, many of us linked hands, one's head could not be held high enough, for now the way was downhill. Someone whooped an Indian war cry, our legs galloped us as never before, the wind lifted our hips as we sprang. Nothing could have checked us; we were in such full stride that even in overtaking others we could fold our arms and look quietly around us.  
  
At the bridge over the brook we came to a stop; those who had overrun it came back. The water below lapped against stones and roots as if it were not already late evening. There was no reason why one of us should not jump onto the parapet of the bridge.  
  
From behind clumps of trees in the distance a railway train came past, all the carriages were lit up, the windowpanes were certainly let down. One of us began to sing a popular catch, but we all felt like singing. We sang much faster than the train was going, we waved our arms because our voices were not enough, our voices rushed together in an avalanche of sound that did us good. When one joins in song with others it is like being drawn on by a fish hook.  
  
So we sang, the forest behind us, for the ears of the distant travelers. The grownups were still awake in the village, the mothers were making down the beds for the night.  
  
Our time was up. I kissed the one next to me, reached hands to the three nearest, and began to run home, none called me back. At the first crossroads where they could no longer see me I turned off and ran by the field paths into the forest again. I was making for that city in the south of which it was said in our village: 'There you'll find queer folk! Just think, they never sleep!' 'And why not?' 'Because they never get tired.' 'And why not?' 'Because they're fools.' 'Don't fools get tired?' 'How could fools get tired!'  
  
At last, about ten o'clock at night, I came to the doorway of the fine house where I was invited to spend the evening, after the man beside me, whom I was barely acquainted with and who had once again thrust himself unasked upon me, had marched me for two long hours around the streets.  
  
'Well!' I said, and clapped my hands to show that I really had to bid him goodbye. I had already made several less explicit attempts to get rid of him. I was tired out. 'Are you going straight in?' he asked. I heard a sound in his mouth that was like the snapping of teeth. 'Yes.'  
  
I had been invited out, I told him when I met him. But it was to enter a house where I longed to be that I had been invited, not to stand here at the street door looking past the ears of the man before me. Nor to fall silent with him, as if we were doomed to stay for a long time on this spot. And yet the houses around us at once took a share in our silence, and the darkness over them, all the way up to the stars. And the steps of invisible passers-by, which one could not take the trouble to elucidate, and the wind persistently buffeting the other side of the street, and a gramophone singing behind the closed windows of some room - they all announced themselves in this silence, as if it were their own possession for the time past and to come.  
  
And my companion subscribed to it in his own name and - with a smile - in mine too, stretched his right arm up along the wall and leaned his cheek upon it, shutting his eyes.  
  
But I did not wait to see the end of that smile, for shame suddenly caught hold of me. It had needed that smile to let me know that the man was a confidence trickster, nothing else. And yet I had been months in the town and thought I knew all about confidence tricksters, how they came slinking out of side streets by night to meet us with outstretched hands like tavernkeepers, how they haunted the advertisement pillars we stood beside, sliding around them as if playing hide-and-seek and spying on us with at least one eye, how they suddenly appeared on the curb of the pavement at cross-streets when we were hesitating! I understood them so well, they were the first acquaintances I had made in the town's small taverns, and to them I owed my first inkling of a ruthless hardness which I was now so conscious of, everywhere on earth, that I was even beginning to feel it in myself. How persistently they blocked our way, even when we had long shaken ourselves free, even when, that is, they had nothing more to hope for! How they refused to give up, to admit defeat, but kept shooting glances at us that even from a distance were still compelling! And the means they employed were always the same: they planted themselves before us, looking as large as possible, tried to hinder us from going where we purposed, offered us instead a habitation in their own bosoms, and when at last all our balked feelings rose in revolt they welcomed that like an embrace into which they threw themselves face foremost.  
  
And it had taken me such a long time in this man's company to recognize the same old game. I rubbed my finger tips together to wipe away the disgrace.  
  
My companion was still leaning there as before, still believing himself a successful trickster, and his self-complacency glowed pink on his free cheek.  
  
'Caught in the act!' said I, tapping him lightly on the shoulder. Then I ran up the steps, and the disinterested devotion on the servants' faces in the hall delighted me like an unexpected treat. I looked at them all, one after another, while they took my greatcoat off and wiped my shoes clean.  
  
With a deep breath of relief and straightening myself to my full height, I then entered the drawing room.  
  
  
  
It was a Sunday morning in the very height of spring. Georg Bendemann, a young merchant, was sitting in his own room on the first floor of one of a long row of small, ramshackle houses stretching beside the river which were scarcely distinguishable from each other in height and coloring. He had just finished a letter to an old friend of his who was now living abroad, had put it into its envelope in a slow and dreamy fashion, and with his elbows propped on the writing table was gazing out of the window at the river, the bridge, and the hills on the farther bank with their tender green.  
  
He was thinking about his friend, who had actually run away to Russia some years before, being dissatisfied with his prospects at home. Now he was carrying on a business in St. Petersburg, which had flourished to begin with but had long been going downhill, as he always complained on his increasingly rare visits. So he was wearing himself out to no purpose in a foreign country, the unfamiliar full beard he wore did not quite conceal the face Georg had known so well since childhood, and his skin was growing so yellow as to indicate some latent disease. By his own account he had no regular connection with the colony of his fellow countrymen out there and almost no social intercourse with Russian families, so that he was resigning himself to becoming a permanent bachelor.  
  
What could one write to such a man, who had obviously run off the rails, a man one could be sorry for but could not help. Should one advise him to come home, to transplant himself and take up his old friendships again - there was nothing to hinder him - and in general to rely on the help of his friends? But that was as good as telling him, and the more kindly the more offensively, that all his efforts hitherto had miscarried, that he should finally give up, come back home, and be gaped at by everyone as a returned prodigal, that only his friends knew what was what and that he himself was just a big child who should do what his successful and home-keeping friends prescribed. And was it certain, besides, that all the pain one would have to inflict on him would achieve its object? Perhaps it would not even be possible to get him to come home at all - he said himself that he was now out of touch with commerce in his native country - and then he would still be left an alien in a foreign land embittered by his friends' advice and more than ever estranged from them. But if he did follow their advice and then didn't fit in at home - not out of malice, of course, but through force of circumstances - couldn't get on with his friends or without them, felt humiliated, couldn't be said to have either friends or a country of his own any longer, wouldn't it have been better for him to stay abroad just as he was? Taking all this into account, how could one be sure that he would make a success of life at home?  
  
For such reasons, supposing one wanted to keep up correspondence with him, one could not send him any real news such as could frankly be told to the most distant acquaintance. It was more than three years since his last visit, and for this he offered the lame excuse that the political situation in Russia was too uncertain, which apparently would not permit even the briefest absence of a small businessman while it allowed hundreds of thousands of Russians to travel peacefully abroad. But during these three years Georg's own position in life had changed a lot. Two years ago his mother had died, since when he and his father had shared the household together, and his friend had of course been informed of that and had expressed his sympathy in a letter phrased so dryly that the grief caused by such an event, one had to conclude, could not be realized in a distant country. Since that time, however, Georg had applied himself with greater determination to the business as well as to everything else.  
  
Perhaps during his mother's lifetime his father's insistence on having everything his own way in the business had hindered him from developing any real activity of his own, perhaps since her death his father had become less aggressive, although he was still active in the business, perhaps it was mostly due to an accidental run of good fortune - which was very probable indeed - but at any rate during those two years the business had developed in a most unexpected way, the staff had had to be doubled, the turnover was five times as great; no doubt about it, further progress lay just ahead.  
  
But Georg's friend had no inkling of this improvement. In earlier years, perhaps for the last time in that letter of condolence, he had tried to persuade Georg to emigrate to Russia and had enlarged upon the prospects of success for precisely Georg's branch of trade. The figures quoted were microscopic by comparison with the range of Georg's present operations. Yet he shrank from letting his friend know about his business success, and if he were to do it now retrospectively that certainly would look peculiar.  
  
So Georg confined himself to giving his friend unimportant items of gossip such as rise at random in the memory when one is idly thinking things over on a quiet Sunday. All he desired was to leave undisturbed the idea of the home town which his friend must have built up to his own content during the long interval. And so it happened to Georg that three times in three fairly widely separated letters he had told his friend about the engagement of an unimportant man to an equally unimportant girl, until indeed, quite contrary to his intentions, his friend began to show some interest in this notable event.  
  
Yet Georg preferred to write about things like these rather than to confess that he himself had got engaged a month ago to a Fraulein Frieda Brandenfeld, a girl from a well-to-do family. He often discussed this friend of his with his fiancee and the peculiar relationship that had developed between them in their correspondence. 'So he won't be coming to our wedding,' said she, 'and yet I have a right to get to know all your friends.' 'I don't want to trouble him,' answered Georg, 'don't misunderstand me, he would probably come, at least I think so, but he would feel that his hand had been forced and he would be hurt, perhaps he would envy me and certainly he'd be discontented and without being able to do anything about his discontent he'd have to go away again alone. Alone - do you know what that means?' 'Yes, but may he not hear about our wedding in some other fashion?' 'I can't prevent that, of course, but it's unlikely, considering the way he lives.' 'Since your friends are like that, Georg, you shouldn't ever have got engaged at all.' 'Well, we're both to blame for that; but I wouldn't have it any other way now.' And when, breathing quickly under his kisses, she still brought out: 'All the same, I do feel upset,' he thought it could not really involve him in trouble were he to send the news to his friend. 'That's the kind of man I am and he'll just have to take me as I am,' he said to himself, 'I can't cut myself to another pattern that might make a more suitable friend for him.'  
  
And in fact he did inform his friend, in the long letter he had been writing that Sunday morning, about his engagement, with these words: 'I have saved my best news to the end. I have got engaged to a Fraulein Frieda Brandenfeld, a girl from a well-to-do family, who only came to live here a long time after you went away, so that you're hardly likely to know her. There will be time to tell you more about her later, for today let me just say that I am very happy and as between you and me the only difference in our relationship is that instead of a quite ordinary kind of friend you will now have in me a happy friend. Besides that, you will acquire in my fiancee, who sends her warm greetings and will soon write you herself, a genuine friend of the opposite sex, which is not without importance to a bachelor. I know that there are many reasons why you can't come to see us, but would not my wedding be precisely the right occasion for giving all obstacles the go-by? Still, however that may be, do just as seems good to you without regarding any interests but your own.'  
  
With this letter in his hand Georg had been sitting a long time at the writing table, his face turned toward the window. He had barely acknowledged, with an absent smile, a greeting waved to him from the street by a passing acquaintance.  
  
At last he put the letter in his pocket and went out of his room across a small lobby into his father's room, which he had not entered for months. There was in fact no need for him to enter it, since he saw his father daily at business and they took their midday meal together at an eating house; in the evening, it was true, each did as he pleased, yet even then, unless Georg - as mostly happened - went out with friends or, more recently, visited his fiancee, they always sat for a while, each with his newspaper, in their common sitting room.  
  
It surprised Georg how dark his father's room was even on this sunny morning. So it was overshadowed as much as that by the high wall on the other side of the narrow courtyard. His father was sitting by the window in a corner hung with various mementoes of Georg's dead mother, reading a newspaper which he held to one side before his eyes in an attempt to overcome a defect of vision. On the table stood the remains of his breakfast, not much of which seemed to have been eaten.  
  
'Ah, Georg,' said his father, rising at once to meet him. His heavy dressing gown swung open as he walked and the skirts of it fluttered around him. -'My father is still a giant of a man,' said Georg to himself.  
  
'It's unbearably dark here,' he said aloud.  
  
'Yes, it's dark enough,' answered his father.  
  
'And you've shut the window, too?'  
  
'I prefer it like that.'  
  
'Well, it's quite warm outside,' said Georg, as if continuing his previous remark, and sat down.  
  
His father cleared away the breakfast dishes and set them on a chest.  
  
'I really only wanted to tell you,' went on Georg, who had been vacantly following the old man's movements, 'that I am now sending the news of my engagement to St. Petersburg.' He drew the letter a little way from his pocket and let it drop back again.  
  
'To St. Petersburg?' asked his father.  
  
'To my friend there,' said Georg, trying to meet his father's eye. - In business hours he's quite different, he was thinking, how solidly he sits here with his arms crossed.  
  
'Oh yes. To your friend,' said his father, with peculiar emphasis.  
  
'Well, you know, Father, that I wanted not to tell him about my engagement at first. Out of consideration for him, that was the only reason. You know yourself he's a difficult man. I said to myself that someone else might tell him about my engagement, although he's such a solitary creature that that was hardly likely - I couldn't prevent that - but I wasn't ever going to tell him myself.'  
  
'And now you've changed your mind?' asked his father, laying his enormous newspaper on the window sill and on top of it his spectacles, which he covered with one hand.  
  
'Yes, I've been thinking it over. If he's a good friend of mine, I said to myself, my being happily engaged should make him happy too. And so I wouldn't put off telling him any longer. But before I posted the letter I wanted to let you know.'  
  
'Georg,' said his father, lengthening his toothless mouth, 'listen to me! You've come to me about this business, to talk it over with me. No doubt that does you honor. But it's nothing, it's worse than nothing, if you don't tell me the whole truth. I don't want to stir up matters that shouldn't be mentioned here. Since the death of our dear mother certain things have been done that aren't right. Maybe the time will come for mentioning them, and maybe sooner than we think. There's many a thing in the business I'm not aware of, maybe it's not done behind my back - I'm not going to say that it's done behind my back - I'm not equal to things any longer, my memory's failing, I haven't an eye for so many things any longer. That's the course of nature in the first place, and in the second place the death of our dear mother hit me harder than it did you. - But since we're talking about it, about this letter, I beg you, Georg, don't deceive me. It's a trivial affair, it's hardly worth mentioning, so don't deceive me. Do you really have this friend in St. Petersburg?'  
  
Georg rose in embarrassment. 'Never mind my friends. A thousand friends wouldn't make up to me for my father. Do you know what I think? You're not taking enough care of yourself. But old age must be taken care of. I can't do without you in the business, you know that very well, but if the business is going to undermine your health, I'm ready to close it down tomorrow forever. And that won't do. We'll have to make a change in your way of living. But a radical change. You sit here in the dark, and in the sitting room you would have plenty of light. You just take a bite of breakfast instead of properly keeping up your strength. You sit by a closed window, and the air would be so good for you. No, Father! I'll get the doctor to come, and we'll follow his orders. We'll change your room, you can move into the front room and I'll move in here. You won't notice the change, all your things will be moved with you. But there's time for all that later, I'll put you to bed now for a little, I'm sure you need to rest. Come, I'll help you to take off your things, you'll see I can do it. Or if you would rather go into the front room at once, you can lie down in my bed for the present. That would be the most sensible thing.'  
  
Georg stood close beside his father, who had let his head with its unkempt white hair sink on his chest.  
  
'Georg,' said his father in a low voice, without moving.  
  
Georg knelt down at once beside his father, in the old man's weary face he saw the pupils, overlarge, fixedly looking at him from the corners of the eyes.  
  
'You have no friend in St. Petersburg. You've always been a leg-puller and you haven't even shrunk from pulling my leg. How could you have a friend out there! I can't believe it.'  
  
'Just think back a bit, Father,' said Georg, lifting his father from the chair and slipping off his dressing gown as he stood feebly enough, 'it'll soon be three years since my friend came to see us last. I remember that you used not to like him very much. At least twice I kept you from seeing him, although he was actually sitting with me in my room. I could quite well understand your dislike of him, my friend has his peculiarities. But then, later, you got on with him very well. I was proud because you listened to him and nodded and asked him questions. If you think back you're bound to remember. He used to tell us the most incredible stories of the Russian Revolution. For instance, when he was on a business trip to Kiev, and ran into a riot, and saw a priest on a balcony who cut a broad cross in blood on the palm of his hand and held the hand up and appealed to the mob. You've told that story yourself once or twice since.'  
  
Meanwhile Georg had succeeded in lowering his father down again and carefully taking off the woolen drawers he wore over his linen underpants and his socks. The not particularly clean appearance of his underwear made him reproach himself for having been neglectful. It should have certainly been his duty to see that his father had clean changes of underwear. He had not yet explicitly discussed with his bride-to-be what arrangements should be made for his father in the future, for they had both of them silently taken it for granted that the old man would go on living alone in the old house. But now he made a quick, firm decision to take him into his own future establishment. It almost looked, on closer inspection, as if the care he meant to lavish there on his father might come too late.  
  
He carried his father to bed in his arms. It gave him a dreadful feeling to notice that while he took the few steps toward the bed the old man on his breast was playing with his watch chain. He could not lay him down on the bed for a moment, so firmly did he hang on to the watch chain.  
  
But as soon as he was laid in bed, all seemed well. He covered himself up and even drew the blankets farther than usual over his shoulders. He looked up at Georg with a not unfriendly eye.  
  
'You begin to remember my friend, don't you?' asked Georg, giving him an encouraging nod.  
  
'Am I well covered up now?' asked his father, as if he were not able to see whether his feet were properly tucked in or not.  
  
'So you find it snug in bed already,' said Georg, and tucked the blankets more closely around him.  
  
'Am I well covered up?' asked the father once more, seeming to be strangely intent upon the answer.  
  
'Don't worry, you're well covered up.'  
  
'No!' cried his father, cutting short the answer, threw the blankets off with a strength that sent them all flying in a moment and sprang erect in bed. Only one hand lightly touched the ceiling to steady him.  
  
'You wanted to cover me up, I know, my young sprig, but I'm far from being covered up yet. And even if this is the last strength I have, it's enough for you, too much for you. Of course I know your friend. He would have been a son after my own heart. That's why you've been playing him false all these years. Why else? Do you think I haven't been sorry for him? And that's why you had to lock yourself up in your office - the Chief is busy, mustn't be disturbed - just so that you could write your lying little letters to Russia. But thank goodness a father doesn't need to be taught how to see through his son. And now that you thought you'd got him down, so far down that you could set your bottom on him and sit on him and he wouldn't move, then my fine son makes up his mind to get married!'  
  
Georg stared at the bogey conjured up by his father. His friend in St. Petersburg, whom his father suddenly knew too well, touched his imagination as never before. Lost in the vastness of Russia he saw him. At the door of an empty, plundered warehouse he saw him. Among the wreckage of his showcases, the slashed remnants of his wares, the falling gas brackets, he was just standing up. Why did he have to go so far away!  
  
'But attend to me!' cried his father, and Georg, almost distracted, ran toward the bed to take everything in, yet came to a stop halfway.  
  
'Because she lifted up her skirts,' his father began to flute, 'because she lifted her skirts like this, the nasty creature,' and mimicking her he lifted his shirt so high that one could see the scar on his thigh from his war wound, 'because she lifted her skirts like this and this you made up to her, and in order to make free with her undisturbed you have disgraced your mother's memory, betrayed your friend, and stuck your father into bed so that he can't move. But he can move, or can't he?'  
  
And he stood up quite unsupported and kicked his legs out. His insight made him radiant.  
  
Georg shrank into a corner, as far away from his father as possible. A long time ago he had firmly made up his mind to watch closely every least movement so that he should not be surprised by any indirect attack, a pounce from behind or above. At this moment he recalled this long-forgotten resolve and forgot it again, like a man drawing a short thread through the eye of a needle.  
  
'But your friend hasn't been betrayed after all!' cried his father, emphasizing the point with stabs of his forefinger. 'I've been representing him here on the spot.'  
  
'You comedian!' Georg could not resist the retort, realized at once the harm done and, his eyes starting in his head, bit his tongue back, only too late, till the pain made his knees give.  
  
'Yes, of course I've been playing a comedy! A comedy! That's a good expression! What other comfort was left to a poor old widower? Tell me - and while you're answering me be you still my living son - what else was left to me, in my back room, plagued by a disloyal staff, old to the marrow of my bones? And my son strutting through the world, finishing off deals that I had prepared for him, bursting with triumphant glee, and stalking away from his father with the closed face of a respectable businessman! Do you think I didn't love you, I, from whom you are sprung?'  
  
Now he'll lean forward, thought Georg, what if he topples and smashes himself! These words went hissing through his mind.  
  
His father leaned forward but did not topple. Since Georg did not come any nearer, as he had expected, he straightened himself again.  
  
'Stay where you are, I don't need you! You think you have strength enough to come over here and that you're only hanging back of your own accord. Don't be too sure! I am still much the stronger of us two. All by myself I might have had to give way, but your mother has given me so much of her strength that I've established a fine connection with your friend and I have your customers here in my pocket!'  
  
'He has pockets even in his shirt!' said Georg to himself, and believed that with this remark he could make him an impossible figure for all the world. Only for a moment did he think so, since he kept on forgetting everything.  
  
'Just take your bride on your arm and try getting in my way! I'll sweep her from your very side, you don't know how!'  
  
Georg made a grimace of disbelief. His father only nodded, confirming the truth of his words, toward Georg's corner.  
  
'How you amused me today, coming to ask me if you should tell your friend about your engagement. He knows it already, you stupid boy, he knows it all! I've been writing to him, for you forgot to take my writing things away from me. That's why he hasn't been here for years, he knows everything a hundred times better than you do yourself, in his left hand he crumples your letters unopened while in his right hand he holds up my letters to read through!'  
  
In his enthusiasm he waved his arm over his head. 'He knows everything a thousand times better!' he cried.  
  
'Ten thousand times!' said Georg, to make fun of his father, but in his very mouth the words turned into deadly	earnest.  
  
'For years I've been waiting for you to come with some such question! Do you think I concern myself with anything else? Do you think I read my newspapers? Look!' and he threw Georg a newspaper sheet which he had somehow taken to bed with him. An old newspaper, with a name entirely unknown to Georg.  
  
'How long a time you've taken to grow up! Your mother had to die, she couldn't see the happy day, your friend is going to pieces in Russia, even three years ago he was yellow enough to be thrown away, and as for me, you see what condition I'm in. You have eyes in your head for that!'  
  
'So you've been lying in wait for me!' cried Georg.  
  
His father said pityingly, in an offhand manner: 'I suppose you wanted to say that sooner. But now it doesn't matter.' And in a louder voice: 'So now you know what else there was in the world besides yourself, till now you've known only about yourself! An innocent child, yes, that you were, truly, but still more truly have you been a devilish human being! - And therefore take note: I sentence you now to death by drowning!'  
  
Georg felt himself urged from the room, the crash with which his father fell on the bed behind him was still in his ears as he fled. On the staircase, which he rushed down as if its steps were an inclined plane, he ran into his charwoman on her way up to do the morning cleaning of the room. 'Jesus!' she cried, and covered her face with her apron, but he was already gone. Out of the front door he rushed, across the roadway, driven toward the water. Already he was grasping at the railings as a starving man clutches food. He swung himself over, like the distinguished gymnast he had once been in his youth, to his parents' pride. With weakening grip he was still holding on when he spied between the railings a motor-bus coming which would easily cover the noise of his fall, called in a low voice: 'Dear parents, I have always loved you, all the same,' and let himself drop.  
  
At this moment an unending stream of traffic was just going over the bridge.  
  
  
  
  
One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found  
himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.  He lay on  
his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could  
see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff  
sections.  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready  
to slide off any moment.  His many legs, pitifully thin compared  
with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he  
looked.  
  
"What's happened to me?" he thought.  It wasn't a dream.  His room,  
a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully  
between its four familiar walls.  A collection of textile samples  
lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and  
above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an  
illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.  It showed  
a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,  
raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm  
towards the viewer.  
  
Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.  
Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel  
quite sad.  "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all  
this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to  
do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present  
state couldn't get into that position.  However hard he threw  
himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.  He  
must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he  
wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when  
he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt  
before.  
  
"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've  
chosen! Travelling day in and day out.  Doing business like this  
takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on  
top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making  
train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different  
people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or  
become friendly with them.  It can all go to Hell!"  He felt a  
slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back  
towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found  
where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little  
white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried  
to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back  
because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.  
  
He slid back into his former position.  "Getting up early all the  
time", he thought, "it makes you stupid.  You've got to get enough  
sleep.  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.  For  
instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning  
to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting  
there eating their breakfasts.  I ought to just try that with my  
boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.  But who knows, maybe that  
would be the best thing for me.  If I didn't have my parents to  
think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have  
gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him  
everything I would, let him know just what I feel.  He'd fall right  
off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up  
there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,  
especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is  
hard of hearing.  Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the  
money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or  
six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.  That's when  
I'll make the big change.  First of all though, I've got to get up,  
my train leaves at five."  
  
And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of  
drawers.  "God in Heaven!" he thought.  It was half past six and the  
hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half  
past, more like quarter to seven.  Had the alarm clock not rung? He  
could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it  
should have been; it certainly must have rung.  Yes, but was it  
possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?  
True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply  
because of that.  What should he do now? The next train went at  
seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and  
the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at  
all feel particularly fresh and lively.  And even if he did catch  
the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office  
assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he  
would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long  
time ago.  The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and  
with no understanding.  What about if he reported sick? But that  
would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of  
service Gregor had never once yet been ill.  His boss would  
certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance  
company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the  
doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed  
that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.  And what's  
more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in  
fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long,  
feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.  
  
He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide  
to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.  
There was a cautious knock at the door near his head.  "Gregor",  
somebody called - it was his mother - "it's quarter to seven.  
Didn't you want to go somewhere?"  That gentle voice! Gregor was  
shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be  
recognised as the voice he had had before.  As if from deep inside  
him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with  
it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort  
of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether  
he had heard properly or not.  Gregor had wanted to give a full  
answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented  
himself with saying: "Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up  
now."  The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticed  
outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with  
this explanation and shuffled away.  But this short conversation  
made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against  
their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came  
knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.  
"Gregor, Gregor", he called, "what's wrong?"  And after a short  
while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: "Gregor!  
Gregor!"  At the other side door his sister came plaintively:  
"Gregor? Aren't you well? Do you need anything?"  Gregor answered to  
both sides: "I'm ready, now", making an effort to remove all the  
strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting  
long pauses between each, individual word.  His father went back to  
his breakfast, but his sister whispered: "Gregor, open the door, I  
beg of you."  Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,  
and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired  
from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was  
at home.  
  
The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being  
disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.  
Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware  
that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by  
lying in bed.  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in  
bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned  
out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would  
slowly resolve themselves today.  He did not have the slightest  
doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first  
sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for  
travelling salesmen.  
  
It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow  
himself up a little and they fell off by themselves.  But it became  
difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.  
He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but  
instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously  
moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to  
control.  If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first  
one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do  
what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free  
and would move about painfully.  "This is something that can't be  
done in bed", Gregor said to himself, "so don't keep trying to do  
it".  
  
The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body  
out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not  
imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move;  
it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he  
carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could  
gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower  
bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower  
part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.  
  
So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed  
first, carefully turning his head to the side.  This he managed  
quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of  
his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.  
But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the  
fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be  
a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry  
on pushing himself forward the same way.  And he could not knock  
himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose  
consciousness.  
  
It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been  
earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching  
his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than  
before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing  
peace and order to this chaos.  He told himself once more that it  
was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible  
thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at  
whatever sacrifice.  At the same time, though, he did not forget to  
remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing  
to desperate conclusions.  At times like this he would direct his  
eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but  
unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was  
enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer  
to offer him.  "Seven o'clock, already", he said to himself when the  
clock struck again, "seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like  
this."  And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly  
as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back  
to their real and natural state.  
  
But then he said to himself: "Before it strikes quarter past seven  
I'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.  And by then  
somebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me  
as well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock."  And so he  
set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body  
out of the bed all at the same time.  If he succeeded in falling out  
of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could  
probably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite hard, and  
probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.  His  
main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which  
even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not  
alarm.  But it was something that had to be risked.  
  
When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new  
method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock  
back and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be  
if somebody came to help him.  Two strong people - he had his father  
and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they would  
only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him  
away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and  
careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the  
little legs would find a use.  Should he really call for help  
though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?  
Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile  
at this thought.  
  
After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have  
been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.  The  
time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final  
decision very soon.  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.  
"That'll be someone from work", he said to himself, and froze very  
still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as  
they danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet.  
"They're not opening the door", Gregor said to himself, caught in  
some nonsensical hope.  But then of course, the maid's firm steps  
went to the door as ever and opened it.  Gregor only needed to hear  
the visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the  
chief clerk himself.  Why did Gregor have to be the only one  
condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly  
suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every  
one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and  
devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he  
couldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of  
hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough  
to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were  
even necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did  
they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so  
suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the  
wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made  
him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with  
all his force out of the bed.  There was a loud thump, but it wasn't  
really a loud noise.  His fall was softened a little by the carpet,  
and Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought, which  
made the sound muffled and not too noticeable.  He had not held his  
head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in  
pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.  
  
"Something's fallen down in there", said the chief clerk in the room  
on the left.  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort  
that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk  
too; you had to concede that it was possible.  But as if in gruff  
reply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his  
highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.  
From the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to let  
him know: "Gregor, the chief clerk is here."  "Yes, I know", said  
Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough  
for his sister to hear him.  
  
"Gregor", said his father now from the room to his left, "the chief  
clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the  
early train.  We don't know what to say to him.  And anyway, he  
wants to speak to you personally.  So please open up this door.  I'm  
sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room."  
Then the chief clerk called "Good morning,  Mr. Samsa". "He isn't  
well", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father  
continued to speak through the door.  "He isn't well, please believe  
me.  Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever  
thinks about the business.  It nearly makes me cross the way he  
never goes out in the evenings; he's been in town for a week now but  
stayed home every evening.  He sits with us in the kitchen and just  
reads the paper or studies train timetables.  His idea of relaxation  
is working with his fretsaw.  He's made a little frame, for  
instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazed  
how nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as soon  
as Gregor opens the door.  Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we wouldn't  
have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he's so  
stubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that he  
is, but he isn't."  "I'll be there in a moment", said Gregor slowly  
and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any  
word of the conversation.  "Well I can't think of any other way of  
explaining it,  Mrs. Samsa", said the chief clerk, "I hope it's  
nothing serious.  But on the other hand, I must say that if we  
people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or  
unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of  
business considerations."  "Can the chief clerk come in to see you  
now then?", asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door  
again.  "No", said Gregor.  In the room on his right there followed  
a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.  
  
So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably  
only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.  And why was  
she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the  
chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if  
that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the  
same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like  
that yet.  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest  
intention of abandoning his family.  For the time being he just lay  
there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in  
would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.  It was  
only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be  
found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could  
be sacked on the spot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible  
to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at  
him and crying.  But the others didn't know what was happening, they  
were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.  
  
The chief clerk now raised his voice, "Mr. Samsa", he called to him,  
"what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more  
than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and  
unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention  
this just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties in  
a way that is quite unheard of.  I'm speaking here on behalf of your  
parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and  
immediate explanation.  I am astonished, quite astonished.  I  
thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you  
suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.  This morning,  
your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to  
appear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recently  
entrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour  
that that could not be the right explanation.  But now that I see  
your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish  
whatsoever to intercede on your behalf.  And nor is your position  
all that secure.  I had originally intended to say all this to you  
in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good  
reason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it.  
Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that  
it's not the time of year to do especially good business, we  
recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no  
business at all,  Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be."  
  
"But Sir", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in  
the excitement, "I'll open up immediately, just a moment.  I'm  
slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get  
up.  I'm still in bed now.  I'm quite fresh again now, though.  I'm  
just getting out of bed.  Just a moment.  Be patient! It's not quite  
as easy as I'd thought.  I'm quite alright now, though.  It's  
shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright  
last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had  
a small symptom of it last night already.  They must have noticed  
it.  I don't know why I didn't let you know at work! But you always  
think you can get over an illness without staying at home.  Please,  
don't make my parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the  
accusations you're making; nobody's ever said a word to me about any  
of these things.  Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sent  
in.  I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few  
hours of rest have given me strength.  You don't need to wait, sir;  
I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to  
tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!"  
  
And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was  
saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was  
easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in  
bed - where he now tried to get himself upright.  He really did want  
to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak  
with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was  
curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.  
If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor's  
responsibility and he could rest.  If, however, they took everything  
calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried  
he really could be at the station for eight o'clock.  The first few  
times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just  
slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and  
stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain  
but he no longer gave any attention to it.  Now he let himself fall  
against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of  
it with his little legs.  By now he had also calmed down, and kept  
quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.  
  
"Did you understand a word of all that?" the chief clerk asked his  
parents, "surely he's not trying to make fools of us". "Oh, God!"  
called his mother, who was already in tears, "he could be seriously  
ill and we're making him suffer.  Grete! Grete!" she then cried.  
"Mother?" his sister called from the other side.  They communicated  
across Gregor's room.  "You'll have to go for the doctor straight  
away.  Gregor is ill.  Quick, get the doctor.  Did you hear the way  
Gregor spoke just now?"  "That was the voice of an animal", said the  
chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's  
screams.  "Anna! Anna!" his father called into the kitchen through  
the entrance hall, clapping his hands, "get a locksmith here, now!"  
And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out  
through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they  
went.  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There  
was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it  
open;  people often do in homes where something awful has happened.  
  
Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.  So they couldn't  
understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to  
him, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the  
sound.  They had realised, though, that there was something wrong  
with him, and were ready to help.  The first response to his  
situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel  
better.  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and  
from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising  
achievements - although he did not really distinguish one from the  
other.  Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to  
make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking  
care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound  
different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure  
he could judge this for himself.  Meanwhile, it had become very  
quiet in the next room.  Perhaps his parents were sat at the table  
whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed  
against the door and listening.  
  
Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.  Once  
there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding  
himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his  
legs.  He rested there a little while to recover from the effort  
involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the  
lock with his mouth.  He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper  
teeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth  
was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw,  
he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that  
he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came  
from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.  
"Listen", said the chief clerk in the next room, "he's turning the  
key."  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should  
have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: "Well done,  
Gregor", they should have cried, "keep at it, keep hold of the  
lock!"  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his  
efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no  
attention to the pain he was causing himself.  As the key turned  
round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself  
upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down  
again with the whole weight of his body as needed.  The clear sound  
of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break  
his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself:  
"So, I didn't need the locksmith after all". Then he lay his head on  
the handle of the door to open it completely.  
  
Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide  
open before he could be seen.  He had first to slowly turn himself  
around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully  
if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the  
room.  He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to  
pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk  
exclaim a loud "Oh!", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.  
Now he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his hand  
pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by  
a steady and invisible force.  Gregor's mother, her hair still  
dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked  
at his father.  Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward  
towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that  
spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto  
her breast.  His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if  
wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked  
uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands  
and wept so that his powerful chest shook.  
  
So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of  
the other door which was still held bolted in place.  In this way  
only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it  
which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.  
Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless,  
grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a  
hospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular  
line of windows piercing its facade; the rain was still  
falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the  
ground one at a time.  The washing up from breakfast lay on the  
table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father,  
breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would  
stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of  
different newspapers.  On the wall exactly opposite there was  
photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword  
in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth  
respect for his uniform and bearing.  The door to the entrance hall  
was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could  
see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down  
below.  
  
"Now, then", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to  
have kept calm, "I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up my  
samples and set off.  Will you please just let me leave? You can  
see", he said to the chief clerk, "that I'm not stubborn and I  
like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but  
without travelling I couldn't earn my living.  So where are you  
going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately,  
then? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to  
work, but that's just the right time to remember what's been  
achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty  
has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence  
and concentration.  You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to  
our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my  
sister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I will  
work my way out of it again.  Please don't make things any harder  
for me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at the  
office.  I know that nobody likes the travellers.  They think we  
earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.  That's  
just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of  
it.  But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the  
staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview  
than the boss himself - it's very easy for a businessman like him to  
make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than  
he should.  And you're also well aware that we travellers spend  
almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very  
easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,  
and it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of  
thing, we don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's when  
we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when we feel  
the harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing  
what caused them.  Please, don't go away, at least first say  
something to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!"  
  
But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to  
speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his  
trembling shoulders as he left.  He did not keep still for a moment  
while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door  
without taking his eyes off him.  He moved very gradually, as if  
there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.  It was  
only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden  
movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in  
a panic.  In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards  
the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force  
waiting to save him.  
  
Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief  
clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be  
put into extreme danger.  That was something his parents did not  
understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that  
this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides,  
they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight  
of any thought for the future.  Gregor, though, did think about the  
future.  The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced  
and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended  
on it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already  
in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.  And  
the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him;  
she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out  
of his shocked state.  But his sister was not there, Gregor would  
have to do the job himself.  And without considering that he still  
was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present  
state, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not -  
be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the  
opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,  
ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but  
Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought  
something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.  Hardly  
had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to  
feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground  
under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they  
were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and  
he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at  
an end.  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side  
as he crouched there on the floor.  His mother was not far away in  
front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but  
then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her  
fingers spread shouting: "Help, for pity's sake, Help!"  The way she  
held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the  
unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;  
she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the  
breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly  
down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming  
to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of  
coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.  
  
"Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.  He had  
completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not  
help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the  
flow of coffee.  That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from  
the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.  
Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief  
clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister,  
he looked back for the last time.  Gregor made a run for him; he  
wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have  
expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and  
disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.  The  
flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor's  
father into a panic as well.  Until then he had been relatively self  
controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk  
himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,  
Gregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand  
(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat  
and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his  
left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his  
foot at him as he went.  Gregor's appeals to his father were of no  
help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly  
turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.  
Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother had  
pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to  
her face.  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards  
the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table  
fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.  Nothing would  
stop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at  
him like a wild man.  Gregor had never had any practice in moving  
backwards and was only able to go very slowly.  If Gregor had only  
been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room  
straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that  
his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a  
lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand  
any moment.  Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no  
choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of  
going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as  
possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn  
himself round.  It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able  
to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact  
now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a  
distance as to which way to turn.  If only his father would stop  
that unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused.  When  
he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that  
hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way  
he had just come.  He was pleased when he finally had his head in  
front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his  
body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.  In  
his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open  
the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space  
to get through.  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should  
be got back into his room as quickly as possible.  Nor would he ever  
have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation  
for getting through the doorway.  What he did, making more noise  
than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there  
had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was  
now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant  
experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without  
regard for what might happen.  One side of his body lifted itself,  
he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white  
door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,  
soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all  
by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air  
while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the  
ground.  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which  
released him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily  
bleeding, deep into his room.  The door was slammed shut with the  
stick, then, finally, all was quiet.  
  
  
  
II  
  
  
It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke  
from his deep and coma-like sleep.  He would have woken soon  
afterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had had  
enough sleep and felt fully rested.  But he had the impression that  
some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front  
room being carefully shut had woken him.  The light from the  
electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling  
and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was  
dark.  He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily  
with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value  
- in order to see what had been happening there.  The whole of his  
left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar,  and he limped  
badly on his two rows of legs.  One of the legs had been badly  
injured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle that  
only one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.  
  
It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it  
actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of  
something to eat.  By the door there was a dish filled with  
sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.  He  
was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he  
had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the  
milk, nearly covering his eyes with it.  But he soon drew his head  
back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender  
left side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able to  
eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the  
milk did not taste at all nice.  Milk like this was normally his  
favourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him  
because of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away  
from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.  
  
Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had  
been lit in the living room.  His father at this time would normally  
be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to  
Gregor's mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not  
a sound to be heard.  Gregor's sister would often write and tell him  
about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in  
recent times.  It was so quiet all around too, even though there  
must have been somebody in the flat.  "What a quiet life it is the  
family lead", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness,  
felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in  
such a nice home for his sister and parents.  But what now, if all  
this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and  
frightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to  
think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and  
down the room.  
  
Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was  
opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door  
on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to  
enter the room but thought better of it.  Gregor went and waited  
immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous  
visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it  
was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in  
vain.  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had  
wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up  
one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time  
during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.  
  
It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room  
was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had  
stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as  
they went away together on tip-toe.  It was clear that no-one would  
come into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plenty  
of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange  
his life.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced  
to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor,  
even though he had been living in it for five years.  Hardly aware  
of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he  
hurried under the couch.  It pressed down on his back a little, and  
he was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt  
immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too  
broad to get it all underneath.  
  
He spent the whole night there.  Some of the time he passed in a  
light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of  
his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague  
hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the  
time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the  
greatest consideration so that his family could bear the  
unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to  
impose on them.  
  
Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his  
decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had  
ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the  
front room and looked anxiously in.  She did not see him straight  
away, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be  
somewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was so  
shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut  
again from outside.  But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she  
opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if  
entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.  
Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch,  
and watched her.  Would she notice that he had left the milk as it  
was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him  
in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn't do it  
herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,  
although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the  
couch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something  
good to eat.  However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately  
and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with  
some surprise.  She immediately picked it up - using a rag,  
not her bare hands - and carried it out.  Gregor was extremely  
curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the  
wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his  
sister, in her goodness, actually did bring.  In order to test his  
taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out  
on an old newspaper.  There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones  
from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a  
few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared  
inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with  
butter and salt.  As well as all that she had poured some water into  
the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's  
use, and placed it beside them.  Then, out of consideration for  
Gregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of  
her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so  
that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for  
himself as he liked.  Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he could  
eat.  What's more, his injuries must already have completely healed  
as he found no difficulty in moving.  This amazed him, as more than  
a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he  
thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.  
"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?", he thought, and was  
already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost  
compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the  
newspaper.  Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with  
pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the  
fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and even  
dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them  
because he couldn't stand the smell.  Long after he had finished  
eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned  
the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.  He  
was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he  
hurried back under the couch.  But he needed great self-control to  
stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room,  
as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he  
could hardly breathe in that narrow space.  Half suffocating, he  
watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a  
broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he  
had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.  
She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden  
lid, and carried everything out.  She had hardly turned her back  
before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched  
himself.  
  
This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the  
morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the  
second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his  
parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor's  
sister would send the maid away on some errand.  Gregor's father and  
mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it  
would have been more than they could stand to have any more  
experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his  
sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were  
indeed suffering enough.  
  
It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the  
doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the  
flat.  As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister,  
thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to  
hear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about  
his room.  It was only later, when she had become a little more used  
to everything - there was, of course, no question of her ever  
becoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes  
catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be  
construed as friendly.  "He's enjoyed his dinner today", she might  
say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him,  
or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more  
frequent, she would often say, sadly, "now everything's just been  
left there again".  
  
Although Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen  
to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard  
anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and  
press his whole body against it.  There was seldom any conversation,  
especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if  
only in secret.  For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime  
was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke  
about the same subject as there were always at least two members of  
the family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and  
it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.  And on  
the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged  
Gregor's mother to let her go without delay.  It was not very clear  
how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter  
of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal as  
if she had done her an enormous service.  She even swore  
emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had  
happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.  
  
Now Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;  
although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.  
Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another  
to eat, and receive no more answer than "no thanks, I've had enough"  
or something similar.  No-one drank very much either.  His sister  
would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping  
for the chance to go and fetch it herself.  When his father then  
said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that  
she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would  
close the matter with a big, loud "No", and no more would be said.  
  
Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had  
explained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances and  
prospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table and took  
some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from  
his business when it had collapsed five years earlier.  Gregor heard  
how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he  
had taken the item he wanted.  What he heard his father say was some  
of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been  
incarcerated in his room.  He had thought that nothing at all  
remained from his father's business, at least he had never told him  
anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.  
Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total  
despair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange  
things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as  
possible.  So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery  
vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling  
representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn  
money in quite different ways.  Gregor converted his success at work  
straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the  
benefit of his astonished and delighted family.  They had been good  
times and they had never come again, at least not with the same  
splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was  
in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear  
them.  They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family,  
they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it,  
although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.  
Gregor only remained close to his sister now.  Unlike him, she was  
very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his  
secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it  
would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some  
other way.  During Gregor's short periods in town, conversation with  
his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever  
mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.  Their  
parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought  
about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he  
planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.  
  
That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his  
mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and  
listening.  There were times when he simply became too tired to  
continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the  
door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the  
slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would  
all go silent.  "What's that he's doing now", his father would say  
after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then  
would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.  
  
When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,  
partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with  
these matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did not  
understand everything the first time.  From these repeated explanations  
Gregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes  
there was still some money available from the old days.  It was not  
a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest  
had accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been using up all the  
money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a  
little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.  
Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at  
this unexpected thrift and caution.  He could actually have used  
this surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and the  
day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come  
much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had  
done things.  
  
This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family  
to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for,  
perhaps, one or two years, no more.  That's to say, it was money  
that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies;  
money to live on had to be earned.  His father was healthy but old,  
and lacking in self confidence.  During the five years that he had  
not been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of  
strain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and become  
very slow and clumsy.  Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go  
and earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her  
just to move about the home, every other day would be spent  
struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.  Would his  
sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of  
seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting  
of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business,  
joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the  
violin.  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money,  
Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself  
onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with  
shame and regret.  
  
He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a  
wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.  Or he might go  
to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto  
the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to  
stare out of it.  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from  
doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered  
than experienced,  as what he actually saw in this way was becoming  
less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had  
used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the  
street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known  
that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite  
being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was  
looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the  
grey earth mingled inseparably.  His observant sister only needed to  
notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its  
exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and  
even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.  
  
If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her  
for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him  
to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain.  His sister,  
naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing  
burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the  
better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also  
able to see through it all so much better.  It had even become very  
unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.  No sooner  
had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a  
precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into  
Gregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it  
hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.  Even if it was  
cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little  
while.  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about  
and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole  
while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to  
spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the  
same room with him with the windows closed.  
  
One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister  
no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance,  
she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him  
still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be  
most horrible.  In itself, his sister's not coming into the room  
would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been  
difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still  
there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and  
closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had  
threatened her and tried to bite her.  Gregor went straight to hide  
himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday  
before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than  
usual.  It made him realise that she still found his appearance  
unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to  
overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that  
protruded from under the couch.  One day, in order to spare her even  
this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the  
couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered  
and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.  
If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do  
was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no  
pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.  She left the  
sheet where it was.  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of  
gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet  
to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.  
  
For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring  
themselves to come into the room to see him.  He would often hear  
them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing  
even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat  
useless and frequently been annoyed with her.  But now the two of  
them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of  
Gregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as  
she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how  
everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this  
time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.  
His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but  
his father and sister at first persuaded her against it.  Gregor  
listened very closely to all this, and approved fully.  Later,  
though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out:  
"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can't you  
understand I have to see him?", and Gregor would think to himself  
that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day  
of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand  
everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was  
still just a child after all, and really might not have had an  
adult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.  
  
Gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised.  Out of  
consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at  
the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did  
not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie  
quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any  
pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit  
of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.  He was especially  
fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying  
on the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light  
swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen  
that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and  
landing on the floor with a crash.  But now, of course, he had far  
better control of his body than before and, even with a fall as  
great as that, caused himself no damage.  Very soon his sister  
noticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, after  
all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about -  
and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by  
removing the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of  
drawers and the desk.  Now, this was not something that she would be  
able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her  
father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the  
cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she  
had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times  
and never to have to open the door unless it was especially  
important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when  
Gregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.  As  
she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her  
joy, but once at the door she went silent.  First, of course, his  
sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room  
was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.  Gregor had  
hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more  
folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just  
been thrown down by chance.  Gregor also refrained, this time, from  
spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his  
mother until later and was simply glad that she had come.  "You can  
come in, he can't be seen", said his sister, obviously leading her  
in by the hand.  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair  
of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they  
pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest  
part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings that  
she would strain herself.  This lasted a very long time.  After  
labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would  
be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too  
heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father got  
home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way  
even more, and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking the  
furniture away would really be any help to him.  She thought just  
the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her  
heart; and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it, he'd been  
used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make  
him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.  Then, quietly,  
almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did  
not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was  
convinced that he did not understand her words, she added "and by  
taking the furniture away, won't it seem like we're showing that  
we've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him to  
cope for himself? I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the  
way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'll  
find everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in  
between all the easier".  
  
Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the  
lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous  
life led by the family during these two months, must have made him  
confused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himself  
why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.  Had he really  
wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out  
with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him  
crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let  
him quickly forget his past when he had still been human.  He had  
come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his  
mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.  Nothing  
should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without  
the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the  
furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that  
was not a loss but a great advantage.  
  
His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the  
idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to his  
parents about the things that concerned him.  This meant that his  
mother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on  
removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had  
thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important  
couch.  It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the  
unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her  
insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to  
crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,  
was of no use to him at all.  Girls of that age, though, do become  
enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever  
they can.  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's  
situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do  
even more for him.  Grete would probably be the only one who would  
dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls  
by himself.  
  
So she refused to let her mother dissuade her.  Gregor's mother  
already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and  
helped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what  
strength she had.  The chest of drawers was something that Gregor  
could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.  
Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out  
of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to  
see what he could do about it.  He meant to be as careful and  
considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who  
came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the  
chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself  
without, of course, moving it an inch.  His mother was not used to  
the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried  
backwards to the far end of the couch.  In his startlement, though,  
he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a  
little.  It was enough to attract his mother's attention.  She stood  
very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to  
Grete.  
  
Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was  
happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after  
all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their  
little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the  
floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed  
from all sides.  With his head and legs pulled in against him and  
his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself  
that he could not stand all of this much longer.  They were emptying  
his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had  
already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools;  
now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place  
clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework  
as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at  
infant school--he really could not wait any longer to see whether  
the two women's intentions were good.  He had nearly forgotten they  
were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while  
they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped  
heavily on the floor.  
  
So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room  
catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times  
not knowing what he should save first before his attention was  
suddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already  
denuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed  
in copious fur.  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself  
against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot  
belly.  This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would  
certainly be taken away by no-one.  He turned his head to face the  
door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they  
came back.  
  
They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite  
soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly  
carrying her.  "What shall we take now, then?", said Grete and  
looked around.  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.  Perhaps  
only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face  
to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly  
and with a tremor in her voice: "Come on, let's go back in the  
living room for a while?"  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind,  
she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down  
from the wall.  Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding  
on his picture.  He would rather jump at Grete's face.  
  
But Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to  
one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the  
wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw  
screamed: "Oh God, oh God!"  Arms outstretched, she fell onto the  
couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.  
"Gregor!" shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.  
 That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his  
transformation.  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of  
smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted  
to help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck  
fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,  
too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in  
the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she  
was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned  
round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut  
Gregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;  
now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles  
she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door  
shut with her foot.  So now Gregor was shut out from his mother,  
who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the  
door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to  
stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and,  
oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,  
he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally  
in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell  
down into the middle of the dinner table.  
  
He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was  
quiet, maybe that was a good sign.  Then there was someone at the  
door.  The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so  
that Grete would have to go and answer it.  His father had arrived  
home.  "What's happened?" were his first words; Grete's appearance  
must have made everything clear to him.  She answered him with  
subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: "Mother's  
fainted, but she's better now.  Gregor got out."  "Just as I  
expected", said his father, "just as I always said, but you women  
wouldn't listen, would you."  It was clear to Gregor that Grete had  
not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something  
bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.  
That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he  
did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been  
possible.  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself  
against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could  
see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go  
back into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to  
drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would  
disappear.  
  
His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like  
that; "Ah!", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both  
angry and glad at the same time.  Gregor drew his head back from the  
door and lifted it towards his father.  He really had not imagined  
his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit  
of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was  
going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.  He really  
ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was  
that really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying  
there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business  
trips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his  
nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even  
able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise  
his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a  
walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in  
his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his  
way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking  
slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and,  
if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his  
companions around him.  He was standing up straight enough now;  
dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by  
the employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar  
of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy  
eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his  
normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his  
scalp.  He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some  
bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,  
put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his  
long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards  
Gregor.  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,  
but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.  Gregor was amazed  
at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time  
with that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new  
life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely  
strict with him.  And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his  
father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even  
slightly.  In this way they went round the room several times  
without anything decisive happening, without even giving the  
impression of a chase as everything went so slowly.  Gregor remained  
all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father  
might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or  
ceiling.  Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly  
would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for  
each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.  
He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his  
lungs had not been very reliable.  Now, as he lurched about in his  
efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could  
hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to  
think of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost  
forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they  
were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and  
protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew  
down and rolled in front of him.  It was an apple; then another one  
immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer  
any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.  He  
had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and  
now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple  
after another.  These little, red apples rolled about on the floor,  
knocking into each other as if they had electric motors.  An apple  
thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off  
without doing any harm.  Another one however, immediately following  
it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag  
himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible  
pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot  
and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.  The last thing  
he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was  
screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his  
sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to  
make it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her  
skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,  
stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms  
around him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost his  
ability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begging  
him to spare Gregor's life.  
  
  
  
III  
  
  
No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it  
remained there as a visible reminder of his injury.  He had suffered  
it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious  
enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current  
sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated  
as an enemy.  On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to  
swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.  
  
Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility -  
probably permanently.  He had been reduced to the condition of an  
ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across  
his room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but  
this deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made  
up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.  
 He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours  
before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room  
where he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the  
family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their  
conversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite  
differently from before.  
  
They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of  
course, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when  
he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.  
 All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.  Soon after dinner,  
his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister  
would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the  
lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who  
had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings  
so that she might be able to get a better position later on.  
Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother  
"you're doing so much sewing again today!", as if he did not know  
that he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again  
while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.  
  
With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take his  
uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg  
Gregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if  
always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his  
superior even here.  The uniform had not been new to start with, but  
as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the  
efforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it.  Gregor  
would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on  
this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,  
while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but  
peaceful.  
  
As soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to his  
father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he  
couldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his  
sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.  But since he had  
been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on  
staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep  
and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the  
chair for his bed.  Then, however much mother and sister would  
importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep  
slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes  
closed and refusing to get up.  Gregor's mother would tug at his  
sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister would  
leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect  
on him.  He would just sink deeper into his chair.  Only when the  
two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes,  
look at them one after the other and say: "What a life! This is what  
peace I get in my old age!"  And supported by the two women he would  
lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load  
himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry  
on by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and  
his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and  
continue being of help to him.  
  
Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to  
give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The  
household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed;  
an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped  
around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest  
work; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of  
the large amount of sewing work she did.  Gregor even learned,  
listening to the evening conversation about what price they had  
hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family  
had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond  
of wearing them at functions and celebrations.  But the loudest  
complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their  
present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no  
imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.  He could  
see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than  
consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it  
would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate  
with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back  
from their decision to move was much more to do with their total  
despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune  
unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related  
to.  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects  
from poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their  
breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for  
strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the  
behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to  
do any more.  And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much  
as when it was new.  After they had come back from taking his father  
to bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where  
it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would  
point to Gregor's room and say "Close that door, Grete", and then,  
when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and  
their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring  
dry-eyed at the table.  
  
Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.  Sometimes he would  
think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the  
next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss  
and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts,  
the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three  
friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a  
provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared  
again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been  
serious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed together  
with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping  
him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was  
glad when they disappeared.  Other times he was not at all in the  
mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about  
the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of  
nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into  
the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to,  
even if he was not hungry.  Gregor's sister no longer thought about  
how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other  
into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the  
morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away  
again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or  
- more often than not - had been left totally untouched.  She still  
cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been  
any quicker about it.  Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here  
and there were little balls of dust and filth.  At first, Gregor  
went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived  
as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks  
without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt  
as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.  
At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for  
her and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up  
Gregor's room was for her and her alone.  Gregor's mother did once  
thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of  
water to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill  
and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.  But his mother  
was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had  
his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change  
in Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living  
room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she  
broke into convulsive tears.  Her father, of course, was startled  
out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and  
helpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standing  
to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning  
of Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sister  
screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again;  
while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself  
with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears,  
thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in  
anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him  
the sight of this and all its noise.  
  
Gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking  
after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but  
even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.  
Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.  Now, though,  
the charwoman was here.  This elderly widow, with a robust bone  
structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in  
her long life, wasn't really repelled by Gregor.  Just by chance one  
day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor's  
room and found herself face to face with him.  He was taken totally  
by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro  
while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in  
front of her.  From then on she never failed to open the door  
slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.  At  
first she would call to him as she did so with words that she  
probably considered friendly, such as "come on then, you old  
dung-beetle!", or "look at the old dung-beetle there!"  Gregor never  
responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he  
was without moving as if the door had never even been opened.  If  
only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day  
instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt  
like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the  
windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to  
speak to him in that way once again.  Gregor was so resentful of it  
that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it  
was like a kind of attack.  Instead of being afraid, the charwoman  
just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there  
with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until  
the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back.  
"Aren't you coming any closer, then?", she asked when Gregor turned  
round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.  
  
Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.  Only if he happened to  
find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he  
might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there  
a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.  At  
first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that  
stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made  
there.  They had got into the habit of putting things into this room  
that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many  
such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to  
three gentlemen.  These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had  
full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door  
one day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy.  This  
meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in  
this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the  
kitchen.  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate,  
especially if it was dirty.  They had moreover brought most of their  
own furnishings and equipment with them.  For this reason, many  
things had become superfluous which, although they could not be  
sold, the family did not wish to discard.  All these things found  
their way into Gregor's room.  The dustbins from the kitchen found  
their way in there too.  The charwoman was always in a hurry, and  
anything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in  
there.  He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object  
and the hand that held it.  The woman most likely meant to fetch the  
things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to  
throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that  
they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown  
unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere  
else.  At first he moved it because, with no other room free where  
he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to  
enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to  
death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.  
  
The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening  
meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so  
the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.  But  
Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after  
all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without  
the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest  
corner.  One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living  
room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who  
rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.  
They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals  
with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked  
up their knives and forks.  Gregor's mother immediately appeared in  
the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister  
with a dish piled high with potatoes.  The food was steaming, and  
filled the room with its smell.  The gentlemen bent over the dishes  
set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before  
eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as  
an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat  
while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether  
it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the  
kitchen.  It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and  
sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again  
and smiled.  
  
The family themselves ate in the kitchen.  Nonetheless, Gregor's  
father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen,  
bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.  
The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.  
 Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.  It  
seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of  
eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had  
wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was  
not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless  
however nice they might be.  "I'd like to eat something", said  
Gregor anxiously, "but not anything like they're eating.  They do  
feed themselves.  And here I am, dying!"  
  
Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the  
violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the  
kitchen.  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the  
one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of  
the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and  
smoking.  When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood  
up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they  
stood pressed against each other.  Someone must have heard them in  
the kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: "Is the playing perhaps  
unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away."  "On  
the contrary", said the middle gentleman, "would the young lady not  
like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after  
all, much more cosy and comfortable?"  "Oh yes, we'd love to",  
called back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player  
himself.  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.  
Gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with  
the music and his sister with the violin.  She calmly prepared  
everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never  
rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated  
courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on  
their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right  
hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother,  
though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving  
the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of  
the way in a corner.  
  
His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention,  
one on each side, to the movements of her hands.  Drawn in by the  
playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had  
his head in the living room.  Before, he had taken great pride in  
how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had  
become so thoughtless about the others.  What's more, there was now  
all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the  
dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest  
movement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on  
his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to  
lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to  
do several times a day.  And despite this condition, he was not too  
shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living  
room.  
  
No-one noticed him, though.  The family was totally preoccupied with  
the violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their  
hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music  
stand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have  
disturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family,  
they  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking  
to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while  
Gregor's father observed them anxiously.  It really now seemed very  
obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or  
entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had  
had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of  
politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.  It was  
especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their  
cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.  Yet Gregor's sister  
was playing so beautifully.  Her face was leant to one side,  
following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy  
expression.  Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his  
head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the  
chance came.  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It  
seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown  
nourishment he had been yearning for.  He was determined to make his  
way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might  
come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her  
playing here as much as he would.  He never wanted to let her out of  
his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance  
should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every  
door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his  
sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of  
her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her  
ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to  
send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about  
it last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - if  
this misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone  
dissuade him from it.  On hearing all this, his sister would break  
out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder  
and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she  
had kept free without any necklace or collar.  
  
"Mr. Samsa!", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father,  
pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at  
Gregor as he slowly moved forward.  The violin went silent, the  
middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends,  
shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.  His father seemed  
to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before  
driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and  
seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing  
had been.  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and  
attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as  
trying to block their view of Gregor with his body.  Now they did  
become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his  
father's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that  
they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without  
knowing it.  They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised  
their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved  
back towards their room only very slowly.  Meanwhile Gregor's sister  
had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was  
suddenly interrupted.  She had let her hands drop and let violin and  
bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if  
still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay  
the instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously  
struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room  
which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more  
quickly moving toward.  Under his sister's experienced hand, the  
pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and  
she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again  
before the three gentlemen had reached the room.  Gregor's father  
seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the  
respect he owed to his tenants.  He urged them and pressed them  
until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of  
the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and  
thereby brought Gregor's father to a halt.  "I declare here and  
now", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother and  
sister to gain their attention too, "that with regard to the  
repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family"  
- here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - "I give  
immediate notice on my room.  For the days that I have been living  
here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will  
consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages  
from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the  
grounds for such an action."  He was silent and looked straight  
ahead as if waiting for something.  And indeed, his two friends  
joined in with the words: "And we also give immediate notice."  With  
that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.  
  
Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his  
hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself  
out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head  
kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.  
Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen  
had first seen him.  His disappointment at the failure of his plan,  
and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible  
for him to move.  He was sure that everyone would turn on him any  
moment, and he waited.  He was not even startled out of this state  
when the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers  
and landed loudly on the floor.  
  
"Father, Mother", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand  
as introduction, "we can't carry on like this.  Maybe you can't see  
it, but I can.  I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I  
can say is: we have to try and get rid of it.  We've done all that's  
humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think  
anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong."  
  
"She's absolutely right", said Gregor's father to himself.  His  
mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to  
cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged  
expression in her eyes.  
  
Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her  
forehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more  
definite ideas.  He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between  
the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and  
occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.  
  
"We have to try and get rid of it", said Gregor's sister, now  
speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with  
coughing to listen, "it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it  
coming.  We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home  
to be tortured like this, we can't endure it.  I can't endure it any  
more."  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down  
the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand  
movements.  
  
"My child", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,  
"what are we to do?"  
  
His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness  
and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier  
certainty.  
  
"If he could just understand us", said his father almost as a  
question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as  
a sign that of that there was no question.  
  
"If he could just understand us", repeated Gregor's father, closing  
his eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite  
impossible, "then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement  
with him.  But as it is ..."  
  
"It's got to go", shouted his sister, "that's the only way, Father.  
You've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.  We've only  
harmed ourselves by believing it for so long.  How can that be  
Gregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not  
possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he  
would have gone of his own free will.  We wouldn't have a brother  
any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember  
him with respect.  As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's  
driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole  
flat and force us to sleep on the streets.  Father, look, just  
look", she suddenly screamed, "he's starting again!"   In her alarm,  
which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even  
abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her  
chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay  
anywhere near Gregor.  She rushed over to behind her father, who had  
become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his  
hands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.  
  
But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all  
his sister.  All he had done was begin to turn round so that he  
could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite  
startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round  
required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help  
himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the  
floor.  He stopped and looked round.  They seemed to have realised  
his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.  Now they all  
looked at him in unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair with  
her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes  
nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father  
with her arms around his neck.  
  
"Maybe now they'll let me turn round", thought Gregor and went back  
to work.  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had  
sometimes to stop and take a rest.  No-one was making him rush any  
more, everything was left up to him.  As soon as he had finally  
finished turning round he began to move straight ahead.  He was  
amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and  
could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak  
state a little while before and almost without noticing it.  He  
concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that  
there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.  
He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.  He did  
not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff,  
but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had  
changed, only his sister had stood up.  With his last glance he saw  
that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.  
  
He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,  
bolted and locked.  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him  
that his little legs collapsed under him.  It was his sister who had  
been in so much of a rush.  She had been standing there waiting and  
sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and  
as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents "At  
last!".  
  
"What now, then?", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the  
darkness.  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move  
at all.  This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being  
able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then  
was unnatural.  He also felt relatively comfortable.  It is true  
that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly  
getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.  
He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the  
inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.  
He thought back of his family with emotion and love.  If it was  
possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his  
sister.  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination  
until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.  He  
watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the  
window too.  Then, without his willing it, his head sank down  
completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.  
  
When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked  
her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her  
hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd  
arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she  
made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing  
special.  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose,  
playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to  
him.  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she  
tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When she had no  
success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked  
at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across  
the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.  
She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide,  
whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom  
doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: "Come and  
'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"  
  
Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had  
to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before  
they could grasp what she was saying.  But then, each from his own  
side, they hurried out of bed.  Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his  
shoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is  
how they went into Gregor's room.  On the way they opened the door  
to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three  
gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never  
been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.  
"Dead?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,  
even though she could have checked for herself and could have known  
it even without checking.  "That's what I said",  replied the  
cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with  
the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a  
movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not  
complete it.  "Now then", said  Mr. Samsa, "let's give thanks to God  
for that". He crossed himself, and the three women followed his  
example.  Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:  
"Just look how thin he was.  He didn't eat anything for so long.  
The food came out again just the same as when it went in". Gregor's  
body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it  
until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did  
he do anything to make them look away.  
  
"Grete, come with us in here for a little while", said  Mrs. Samsa  
with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom  
but not without looking back at the body.  The cleaner shut the door  
and opened the window wide.  Although it was still early in the  
morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.  It  
was already the end of March, after all.  
  
The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in  
amazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.  
"Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner  
irritably.  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and  
silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's  
room.  They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their  
hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite  
light in the room.  
  
Then the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in his  
uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.  All  
of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her  
face against her father's arm.  
  
"Leave my home.  Now!", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and  
without letting the women from him.  "What do you mean?", asked the  
middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled  
sweetly.  The other two held their hands behind their backs and  
continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud  
quarrel which could only end in their favour.  "I mean just what I  
said", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a  
straight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there still,  
looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were  
rearranging themselves into new positions.  "Alright, we'll go  
then", he said, and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had been  
suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from  
Mr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide  
and briefly nodded to him several times.  At that, and without  
delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front  
hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time  
before and had been listening to what was being said.  Now they  
jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that  
Mr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the  
connection with their leader.  Once there, all three took their hats  
from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a  
word and left the premises.  Mr. Samsa and the two women followed  
them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust  
the men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how  
the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many  
steps.  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and  
would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the  
more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's  
boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his  
way up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women came  
away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.  
  
They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation  
and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but  
they were in serious need of it.  So they sat at the table and wrote  
three letters of excusal,  Mr. Samsa to his employers,  Mrs. Samsa  
to her contractor and Grete to her principal.  The cleaner came in  
while they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished  
her work for that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded  
without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when  
the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up  
in irritation.  "Well?", asked  Mr. Samsa.  The charwoman stood in  
the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous  
good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked  
to.  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which  
had been a source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she had  
been working for them, swayed gently in all directions.  "What is it  
you want then?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most  
respect for.  "Yes", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh  
that made her unable to speak straight away, "well then, that thing  
in there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it.  
 That's all been sorted out."   Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over  
their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were  
writing;  Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing  
everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite  
clear that she was not to.  So, as she was prevented from telling  
them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in  
and, clearly peeved, called out "Cheerio then, everyone", turned  
round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.  
  
"Tonight she gets sacked", said  Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply  
from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have  
destroyed the peace they had only just gained.  They got up and went  
over to the window where they remained with their arms around each  
other.  Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat  
there watching for a while.  Then he called out: "Come here, then.  
Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and give me a  
bit of attention". The two women immediately did as he said,  
hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then  
they quickly finished their letters.  
  
After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was  
something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the  
open country outside the town.  They had the tram, filled with warm  
sunshine, all to themselves.  Leant back comfortably on their seats,  
they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination  
they were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each  
other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good  
and held particularly good promise for the future.  The greatest  
improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite  
easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was  
smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by  
Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more  
practical.  All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.  With all the  
worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,  
while they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost  
simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was  
blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They became  
quieter.  Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing  
it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for  
her.  And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good  
intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the  
first to get up and stretch out her young body.  
  
  
  
She breezed into my office one cold September morning. I'd been enjoying a hot cup of Starbuck's finest and surfing the web for local news. The famous lexical semanticist Professor Edgar Nettleston had been found dead, a gunshot wound to the head. The police verdict was suicide.  
  
     She held out an elegant hand as she floated towards me and I glimpsed a wedding band with a stone the size of a peanut M&M.  
  
     "I'm Edith Nettleston."  
  
     "Sorry about the old man."  
  
     "I'm not. He loved me, but he loved words more. I'll be brief. My husband was working on a paper that will rock the very foundation of lexical semantics. It's worth a fortune in lecture tours, but nobody can find it. I believe his suicide note is a clue to its whereabouts."  
  
     She removed a scrap of paper from her blouse.  
  
     "edith. i'm not going to whine, i've had a good life. i've found wealth and happiness as a teacher, a seller of knowledge. but i find myself depressed beyond hope ... and so i'm choosing the hour and manner of my own demise. i have treated you badly. i demanded you dyed your brown curls blonde. i thought i could buy you when i should have won your love. i called you a witch. i'd complain: where's the woman i married? i said you ate too much. if i wanted change, i could have used a carrot rather than a stick. you probably wanted to wring my neck. forgive me. farewell."  
  
     "It's all written in lower case. My husband was a stickler for correct grammar. I refuse to believe it doesn't mean something."  
  
     "Mrs. Nettleston, I think I can help you. There's a couple of odd things about this letter. Firstly, as you say, it's written entirely in lower case. Mr. Nettleston was a world-renowned lexical semanticist, not a teenager texting his BFFs."  
  
     "Secondly, it has a more than usual number of homophones, words where there is another word with the same sound but different spelling and meaning. When dealing with a lexical semanticist, that's surely no accident."  
  
"If we read those homophones in order, we have: whine, seller, hour, manner. And translating to their homophones: Wine cellar our manor."  
  
     Several hours later, we arrived at the Nettlestons' country house and immediately headed for the basement. A flip of a light switch revealed tunnels filled with rows of dark bottles.  
  
     "Where is it? It would take years to search this place."  
  
     "Not so fast, Mrs. Nettleston. First I have to ask you something: your wedding ring diamond, how large is it?  
  
     "It's eight carats. Edgar wouldn't stop talking about it."  
  
     "That's what I feared." I pulled out my trusty revolver. "How you must have hated him and his lexical semantics! You figured you'd kill him and keep the money from the paper yourself.

On a mango tree in a jungle, there lived many birds. They were happy in their small nests. Before the onset of the rainy season, all the animal of the jungle repaired their homes. The birds also made their homes more secure.  
  
Many birds brought twigs and leaves and others wove their nests. “We should also store some food for our children," chirped one of the birds. And they collected food, until they had enough to see them through the rainy season. They kept themselves busy preparing for the tough times.  
  
Soon the rains came. It was followed by thunder and lighting. All the animals and birds stayed in their homes.  
  
It continued raining for many days. One day, a monkey wet in the rain came into the forest. He sat on a branch, shivering with cold, water dripping from its body.  
  
The poor monkey tried his best to get shelter, but in vain. The leaves were not enough to save him from the rains. “Brrr! It is so cold!" said the monkey.  
  
The birds were watching all this. They felt sorry for the monkey but there was little they could do for him. One of them said, “Brother! Our small nests are not enough to give you shelter."  
  
Another bird said, “All of us prepared for the rainy season. If you had, you would not be in this piteous situation."  
  
“How dare you tell me what to do?" said the monkey, growling at the bird. The monkey angrily pounced on the bird’s nest, tore it and threw it on the ground. The bird and her chicks were helpless.  
  
The poor bird thought, “Fools never value good advice. It is better not to advise them."

Long ago, a hawk lived on the top of a hill. At the foot of the hill there was a banyan tree on which a crow used to perch everyday. The crow was very foolish. He would imitate everyone.  
  
The hawk atop the hill would fly down everyday in search of food. The crow watched the hawk circling in the air for long hours and swooping down when he saw his prey. The hawk gifted with eyes that could see long distances would spot his prey from the hill top and then fly down to pounce upon the prey.  
  
The crow watched the hawk thinking, “Hunh! If the hawk can do that, I too can. What does he think? One day, I will show the hawk that I can do the same thing."  
  
A few days later, as the hawk was circling in the air, the crow decided to do the same. Suddenly a baby rabbit came out of the bushes. The hawk saw it and the crow too saw the rabbit.  
  
Before the crow could move, the hawk swooped down, caught hold of the rabbit in his strong sharp talons and flew away. “Swoosh!" was all the crow heard as the hawk disappeared in the sky with his prey. “Hmmph! That is no great skill," thought the crow, angrily.  
  
Next moment he spotted a big fat mouse coming out of a hole. Without wasting time, the crow swooped down. Like the hawk he tried to catch the mouse in his claws.  
  
But the mouse saw the crow and moved away, the crow crashed against the hill. “Eeeaaa!" cried the crow in pain.  
  
Just then the hawk came flying down. “I hope, now you know it is not easy to hunt and it is not easy to imitate, either," said the hawk and flew away.  
  
There after, the crow never imitated any one in its life. It lived happily with the god-given abilities.  
  
Long, long ago, in a dense forest there were thousands of tall and beautiful trees. They were happy, but proud of themselves. Among them there also an ugly tree whose branches were badly twisted. Its roots had uneven curves. All the trees made fun of that ugly tree.  
  
  
  
“How are you, hunchback?" the other trees always shouted and their laughter made the ugly tree feel sad. But, he never raised a voice against them. The ugly tree thought, “I wish I were as beautiful as the other trees. Why did God do this to me? Neither can I provide shade to the travelers not can the birds make their nests on me. Nobody needs me."  
  
  
One day, a woodcutter came to the forest. He took a look at the trees and said, “These trees are lovely. I must cut them." As soon as he picked up his axe the trees became frightened.  
  
  
  
‘Chop, Chop, Chop’ went the woodcutter’s axe and one by one the trees started to fall. “None of us is going to be spared," screamed one of the beautiful trees. Soon that tree too was brought to ground by the woodcutter’s axe.  
  
  
  
By now, the woodcutter had come near to the ugly tree. He had just raised his axe when suddenly he noticed how crooked the ugly tree was. “Hmm! This crooked tree seems to be useless for me. I cannot make long straight logs of this ugly tree," he thought. And he moved towards another beautiful tree. The ugly tree heaved a huge sigh of relief. He realized that by making him ugly, God had actually given him a boon.  
  
  
  
From that day the ugly tree never complained. He was happy with his crooked branches. He never forgot how he was spared from t he woodcutter’s axe, only because he was crooked and ugly.  
  
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.  
  
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.  
  
AT that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."  
  
So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.  
  
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."  
  
His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy. My son was lost. Now he is fount."  
  
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."  
  
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"  
  
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"  
  
The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.  
  
Tigers eat flesh of other animals in the forest. Generally tigers do not kill tigers. They like only the flesh of other animals. A tiger has to be very quick in catching other animals. But an old tiger or a wounded tiger can not run fast. At such times it can only catch people. People can not run as fast as animals. Therefore they became easy prey to tigers or other animals. After eating human flesh once, a tiger will not get any other flesh. Such a tiger is called a man-eater.  
  
Once a tiger in a jungle in Uttar Pradesh in India turned a man-eater. It had killed women and men in the forest. These people had gone into the forest to collect firewood, fruits, roots and other things. After such incidents people stopped going into the forest.  
  
Then the man-eater started to visit the nearby villages quite often. It killed people or domestic animals. The villages became panicky. The concerned government wanted to do something. It requested Jim Corbett to help the villagers. He agreed to track down the man-eater.  
  
Jim Corbett was an expert hunter. He had developed a lot of experience with tigers and other wild animals. He was a lover of wild life. He did not like to kill wild animals for pleasure or sport. But he had not hesitated to kill man-eaters. This was only to help the people in trouble.  
  
Jim Corbett arrived at the village with his rifle. The rifle was a powerful one. It could kill big and strong animals like the lion, the tiger and elephant. He had collected all the information regarding the man-eater. He selected a place. The tiger used to come there often. Jim Corbett built a platform. This platform was fixed on a high branch. A young buffalo was tied to the nearby tree. Jim Corbett waited all night. But the tiger did not come. Perhaps it had scented the hiding man and his powerful.  
  
Jim Corbett changed his plan. He went back to the village. After that the tiger came. It killed the buffalo. Then it dragged the dead buffalo in the jungle. The villagers told Jim Corbett this news. Jim Corbett then went into the forest in search of the tiger. At last he reached the place. He climbed a tree to find out the tiger. The tiger had eaten a portion of the dead body of the buffalo. It was lying at a distance. Slowly and cautiously he followed the track. He found the tiger resting after a good meal. At first he hesitated to shoot a sleeping tiger. But then this was not a good tiger. It was a man-eater. With this thought in mind, he sent two bullets into the sleeping tiger’s head. The tiger died at once. The villagers were happy.  
  
Jim Corbett was rewarded for his bravery.  
  
Ali and Abraham were brothers. Their mother died very early. Their father also died after some time. He left for his sons a cow and a date-tree.  
  
Ali was cunning. He was greedy too. Abraham was kind and honest. He trusted his elder brother. They wanted to divide their father’s property. Ali said, “I will be very fair with you, Abraham. You take the front portion of the cow as your share. I will take the hind side of the cow. Each one gets his profit only from his share." In the same way the tree was also divided. The upper part of the tree went to Ali. And the lower part of the tree went to Abraham.  
  
Abraham fed the cow very well fresh grass and water. The cow became healthy. It gave lot of milk. Ali got the milk. He sold the milk and got a lot of money. But he did not hare the money with Abraham. Abraham asked his brother about his share of money. Ali replied, “I got the milk from my portion of our cow. Hind part is mine as per the agreement. Each of us gets the benefits only from his part." Abraham said nothing.  
  
A wise man advised Abraham. He said some thing in the ear of Abraham. The next day Ali was milking the cow. Then Abraham beat the cow in the front portion. The cow started kicking. Ali shouted at Abraham. “You fool! Why do you beat the cow? Do not see me milking the cow?"  
  
“The front portion of the cow is mine. I can do anything. That is our agreement," said Abraham.  
  
Ali could not say anything. Finally he agreed to share the money. Abraham said, “Not just money. You must also share the work of feeding and taking care of the cow too." Ali agreed.  
  
With regard to the tree, Ali had taken upper part of the tree. He made holes on the upper part of the tree. A kind of sweet-smelling juice came out of these holes. The juice was collected in pots. These pots were kept near the holes. Ali sold the juice for money. But he did not share either the money or the juice with his brother.  
  
Again the wise man advised Abraham. The next day Ali was on the top of the tree. He was fixing pots near the holes. At that time Abraham was cutting the lower part of the tree. Ali shouted at Abraham. But Abraham reminded Ali about the agreement. He said, “I can do anything with my part. You can not question or stop me."  
  
Ali now realized his mistakes. He said, “Abraham, I have been a bad brother to you. I feel ashamed of my selfishness. I ask your pardon. I promise to look after you well hereafter."  
  
And so he did. Both the brothers lived happily. They shared the profit.  
  
Once there was a rich man in Thailand. His name was Chulong. He was a very rich man. Yet he wanted more riches, more money.  
  
One day he was walking in his garden. He saw a strange bird in a bush. It was very small. But it had very beautiful and colorful features. Its voice was also very sweet. Chulong had never seen such a bird in his life. He slowly went near the bush unseen. He caught the bird. Now the bird began to speak.  
  
“Why have you caught me?" the bird asked.  
  
“I want to make money. I can sell you for a big amount," replied Chulong.  
  
“But you are already rich. Why do you want more?" asked the bird.  
  
“Because I want to become richer and richer," replied Chulong.  
  
“But do not dream of making money through me!" said the bird. It further added, “You can not sell me. Nobody will buy me, because, in imprisonment, I lose my beauty and my sweet voice." Then it slowly turned into a black bird.  
  
The beautiful features were now looking like the feathers of a crow.  
  
Chulong hopes of making money were shattered. He said angrily, “I will kill you, and I will eat your meat."  
  
“Eat me! I am so small. You will not get any meat out of me," replied the bird.  
  
Chulong could not answer. The bird then suggested, “Well set me free. In return I shall teach you three simple but useful rules."  
  
“What is the use of the rules? I want only money," said Chulong. He was irritated.  
  
“But these rules can profit you greatly," added the bird.  
  
“Profit me! Really? Then I shall set you free. But how can I trust you? You may fly away," said Chulong.  
  
“I give you my word. And I always keep my word," said the bird.  
  
Chulong wanted to take a chance. He released the bird. It flew up at once. Then it sat on the branch of a tree. Its color started changing. It became beautiful again.  
  
Chulong asked, “Now teach me the rules."  
  
“Certainly," said the bird.  
  
Then it added, “The first rule is Never Believe everything others say. The second rule is Never be sad about something you do not have. The third rule is Never throw away what you have in your hand."  
  
“You silly bird," shouted Chulong. And he added, “These three rules are known to every one. You have cheated me."  
  
But the bird said, “Chulong, just sit down for a while. Think about all your actions of today. You had me in your hands, but you threw me away (released me). You believed all that I said. And you are sad about not having me. The rules are simple. But you never followed them. Now do you see the value of the rules?" so saying the bird flew away and disappeared from his sight.  
  
Once there lived a dog. He was very greedy. There were many times that he had to pay for his greed. Each time the dog promised himself, “I have learnt my lesson. Now I will never be greedy again." But he soon forgot his promises and was as greedy as ever.  
  
One afternoon, the dog was terribly hungry. He decided to go look for something to eat. Just outside his house, there was a bridge. “I will go and look for food on the other side of the bridge. The food there is definitely better," he thought to himself.  
  
He walked across the wooden bridge and started sniffing around for food. Suddenly, he spotted a bone lying at a distance. “Ah, I am in luck. This looks a delicious bone," he said.  
  
Without wasting any time, the hungry dog picked up the bone and was just about to eat it, when he thought, “Somebody might see here with this bone and then I will have to share it with them. So, I had better go home and eat it." Holding the bone in his mouth, he ran towards his house.  
  
While crossing the wooden bridge, the dog looked down into the river. There he saw his own reflection. The foolish dog mistook it for another dog. “There is another dog in the water with bone in its mouth," he thought. Greedy, as he was, he thought, “How nice it would be to snatch that piece of bone as well. Then, I will have two bones."  
  
So, the greedy dog looked at his reflection and growled. The reflection growled back, too. This made the dog angry. He looked down at his reflection and barked, “Woof! Woof!" As he opened his mouth, the bone in his mouth fell into the river. It was only when the water splashed that the greedy dog realized that what he had seen was nothing but his own reflections and not another dog. But it was too late. He had lost the piece of bone because of his greed. Now he had to go hungry.  
  
A young student of Zen was going to the market to buy vegetables for the monastery where he was studying. On the way he met a student from another monastery.  
  
“Where are you going?" asked the first student.  
  
“Wherever my legs take me," replied the other.  
  
The first student pondered over the answer as he was sure it had some deep significance.  
  
When he returned to the monastery, he reported the conversation to his teacher, who said: “You should have asked him what he would do if he had no legs."  
  
The next day the student was thrilled to see the same boy coming towards him.  
  
“Where are you going?" he asked and without waiting for a reply continued, “Wherever your legs take you, I suppose. Well, let me ask you . . ."  
  
“You’re mistaken," interrupted the other boy. “Today I’m going wherever the wind blows."  
  
This answer so confused the first boy that he could not think of anything to say.  
  
When he reported the matter to his teacher, the old man said: “You should have asked him what he would do if there were no wind."  
  
Some days later the student saw the boy in the market again and rushed to confront him, confident that this time he would have the last word.  
  
“Where are you going?" he asked. “Wherever your legs take you or wherever the wind blows? Well, let me ask you . . . . "  
  
“No, no," interrupted the boy. “Today I’m going to buy vegetables."  
  
Ryokan was a Zen teacher of repute.  
  
One day a fisherman saw him walking on the beach soon after a storm. The storm had washed up thousands of starfish on the shore, and they were beginning to dry up. Soon all of them would be dead. Ryokan was picking up starfish and throwing them into the sea.  
  
The fisherman caught up with the teacher and said, “Surely, you cannot hope to throw all these starfish back into the sea? They will die in their thousands here. I’ve seen it happen before. Your effort will make no difference."  
  
“It will to this one," said Ryokan, throwing back another starfish into the sea.  
  
A Zen student said to his teacher, “Master, I have an ungovernable temper. Help me get rid of it."  
  
“You have something very strange," said the teacher.  
  
“Show it to me."  
  
“Right now I cannot show it to you."  
  
“Why not?"  
  
“It arises suddenly."  
  
“Then it cannot be your own true nature," said the teacher, “if it were, you would be able to show it to me at any time. Why are you allowing something that is not yours to trouble your life?"  
  
Thereafter whenever the student felt his temper rising he remembered his teacher’s words and checked his anger.  
  
In time, he developed a calm and placid temperament.  
  
The great Zen teacher, Benzei had many pupils.  
  
One day, one of them was caught stealing by his fellow-students and they reported him to Benzei. But he took no action against the boy.  
  
A few days later the same boy was again caught stealing. And again Benzei did nothing.  
  
This angered the other students who drew up a petition asking for the dismissal of the thief. They threatened to leave en masse if the boy was allowed to stay.  
  
The teacher called a meeting of the students. When they had assembled he said to them: “You are good boys who know what is right and what is wrong. If you leave you will have no trouble in joining some other school. But what about your brother who does not even know the difference between right and wrong? Who will teach him if I don’t? No, I cannot ask him to go even if it means losing all of you."  
  
Tears coursed down the cheeks of the boy who had stolen. He never stole again and in later life became renowned for his integrity.  
  
A schoolteacher used to take a short nap every afternoon.  
  
When his pupils asked him why he did so, he said that he went to dreamland to meet ancient sages.  
  
One extremely hot day some of the pupils fell asleep in the afternoon. When the school-teacher chided them, they said, "We went to meet the sages in dreamland."  
  
"What did they say?" demanded the teacher.  
  
"We asked them if a school- teacher came there every afternoon, but they said they had seen no such person."  
  
A young student of Zen happened to break a precious vase belonging to his teacher.  
  
When he heard his teacher's footsteps, he quickly held the broken vase behind him. As the teacher walked up to him, he asked, "Why does one die, master?"  
  
"It's natural," said the teacher. "Everything has a beginning and an end. Everything has just so long to live and then has to die."  
  
The student held out the pieces of the broken vase and said, "The time for your vase to die had come."  
  
Ryokan, the Zen teacher, was requested by his sister-in-law to come to her house and talk to her son.  
  
“He does no work, squanders his father’s money in wild parties and is neglecting the estate," she complained. “If he does not reform, we will be ruined."  
  
Ryokan went to his brother’s house and met his nephew who was genuinely pleased to see him. The two of them had spent many happy hours together before Ryokan had turned to Zen and entered the monastery.  
  
The young man knew why his uncle had come and braced himself for the scolding he was sure he would receive. But Ryokan said not a word in rebuke, the whole day.  
  
The next morning when it was time for him to go, he put on his garments and then said to his nephew: “Will you help me tie the thongs of my sandals? My hands shake and I cannot do it."  
  
His nephew helped him willingly.  
  
“Thank you," said Ryokan. “A man becomes older and feebler day by day. You remember how strong and robust I used to be?"  
  
“I do," said his nephew, thoughtfully. “I do indeed remember how you used to be."  
  
It was the moment of truth for him. He suddenly realized that his mother and all those who had looked after him had become old and that it was now his turn to look after them and to take on the responsibilities of the household and the community.  
  
He gave up his dissolute life forever.  
  
Kubera, god of wealth, had become arrogant. One day he decided to host an extravagant feast for the gods, such a feast as never had been hosted before. It would increase his prestige and show all men and gods the extent of his wealth and influence.  
  
Accordingly, he went to Mount Kailash to invite Lord Shiva. Shiva was his patron. Kubera owed all his wealth to Shiva who, pleased with his devotion had given him the boon that his wealth would never diminish, no matter how much he spent.  
  
Shiva declined to come but said he would send his son, Ganesha. Kubera was disappointed. Shiva's presence would have been a feather in his cap. But at least he was sending Ganesha. It would have been a terrible snub if no one from the family were to come. Kubera resolved to make the feast so grand that Shiva's absence would not be felt.  
  
The guests were many, thousands of them, both gods and men. They were accommodated in a huge hall built especially for the purpose. The chief guest, Ganesha, was the last to come.  
  
The moment he entered, he began to ask for food. He was shown to a seat of honor and tantalizing dishes were set before him. He gulped them down and asked for more. He was given a second helping and then a third but his appetite remained undiminished.  
  
Kubera ordered his army of cooks to produce more food but they could not keep pace with Ganesha's eating frenzy. The elephant-god was eating food meant for thousands. When he had finished all the food set before him, he began to shout, "Give me more, give me more!" and then getting impatiently to his feet, rushed to the enormous kitchen and devoured all the food there.  
  
Kubera was aghast. All the food was gone and the guests had not been fed. Worse, Ganesha was still hungry.  
  
"You call this a feast?" Ganesha admonished Kubera. "There's no food here. I'm going home."  
  
Kubera pleaded with him to stay, promising him more food in a little while but his young guest was in no mood to listen. He got on his mount and sped away. Kubera, fearing Shiva's wrath, followed in his own vehicle. When he arrived at Kailash, he found Ganesha complaining loudly to his father about the lack of food at his feast.  
  
"What's this I hear, Kubera?" asked Shiva, turning to the god. "No food at your feast?"  
  
"I....I....," mumbled Kubera.  
  
"Go in and ask your mother for some food," said Shiva to his son. "I'm sure Kubera did his best."  
  
"I did, I did, my lord," said Kubera, feeling miserable. His feast had turned into a farce. Instead of adding to his prestige it had made him a laughing stock. But he was relieved to see that Shiva did not appear to be angry.  
  
He fell at his patron's feet and begged forgiveness for his pride.  
  
Ravana once went to challenge Surya, the Sun-God, to a fight. When he reached the Solar Region he saw that the sun was about to rise and sent an envoy to inform Surya of his arrival and the reason for his coming.  
  
"Tell him," he instructed his envoy, "that he should either stay and fight or accept defeat."  
  
Surya had begun his ascent into the sky when the envoy reached the gates of his palace.  
  
One of the gatekeepers, Dandi, shouted out Ravana's message to his master.  
  
Surya shrugged and continued rising.  
  
"Tell Ravana," he said, "that I've no time to spare."  
  
Ravana went away shouting that he had defeated the Sun.  
  
Fire being so important to us, it is not surprising that several mythologies of the world contain references to how fire was first revealed to or obtained by man.  
  
In Polynesian mythology it was the god Maui who gave fire to mortals after stealing it from the fire goddess.  
  
Prometheus of Greek mythology too stole fire from the gods to give to man.  
  
The Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert have their own legend about fire. Interestingly, in their tale, man gets fire through his own efforts and not through the kindness of any god.  
  
Eos, Goddess of Dawn fell in love with a youth named Tithonius, and the two spent many happy years together. But while Eos being a goddess retained her youth, Tithonius began to age. He asked his beloved to grant him immortality. She couldn’t do it on her own so she pleaded his case with Zeus, the supreme deity.  
  
Zeus reluctantly granted the boon.  
  
The story unfortunately does not have a happy ending. Tithonius had forgotten to ask for eternal youth. So though he could not die he could age. As his age advanced he became wrinkled and hunchbacked and revoltingly ugly. He pleaded with Eos to help him.  
  
She could not take back the gift of immortality nor could she give him back his youth. But she could change his form. She turned him into a grasshopper.  
  
Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away.  
  
  
  
On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became friends. They lived happily in the forest afterwards.  
  
  
  
Moral : A friend in need is a friend indeed.  
  
  
A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were friends. The Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.  
  
  
  
The flavour was not much to the taste of the guest and presently he broke out with “My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me and I promise you shall live on the fat of the land."  
  
  
  
So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates.  
  
  
  
The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided. But before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again. But some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. "Good bye," said he, "I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace."  
  
One day an elephant wandered into a forest in search of friends.  
  
He saw a monkey on a tree.  
  
“Will you be my friend?" asked the elephant.  
  
Replied the monkey, “You are too big. You can not swing from trees like me."  
  
Next, the elephant met a rabbit. He asked him to be his friends.  
  
But the rabbit said, “You are too big to play in my burrow!"  
  
Then the elephant met a frog.  
  
“Will you be my friend? He asked.  
  
“How can I?" asked the frog.  
  
“You are too big to leap about like me."  
  
The elephant was upset. He met a fox next.  
  
“Will you be my friend?" he asked the fox.  
  
The fox said, “Sorry, sir, you are too big."  
  
The next day, the elephant saw all the animals in the forest running for their lives.  
  
The elephant asked them what the matter was.  
  
The bear replied, “There is a tier in the forest. He’s trying to gobble us all up!"  
  
The animals all ran away to hide.  
  
The elephant wondered what he could do to solve everyone in the forest.  
  
Meanwhile, the tiger kept eating up whoever he could find.  
  
The elephant walked up to the tiger and said, “Please, Mr. Tiger, do not eat up these poor animals."  
  
“Mind your own business!" growled the tiger.  
  
The elephant has a no choice but to give the tiger a hefty kick.  
  
The frightened tiger ran for his life.  
  
The elephant ambled back into the forest to announce the good news to everyone.  
  
All the animals thanked the elephant.  
  
They said, “You are just the right size to be our friend."  
  
This is a short story about Hungry Wolf.  
  
  
  
Once, a wolf was very hungry. It looked for food here and there. But it couldn't get any. At last it found a loaf of bread and piece of meat in the hole of a tree.  
  
  
  
The hungry wolf squeezed into the hole. It ate all the food. It was a woodcutter's lunch. He was on his way back to the tree to have lunch. But he saw there was no food in the hole, instead, a wolf.  
  
  
  
On seeing the woodcutter, the wolf tried to get out of the hole. But it couldn't. Its tummy was swollen.  
  
  
  
The woodcutter caught the wolf and gave it nice beatings.  
  
The Oak tree always thought that he was far stronger than the reeds.  
  
  
He said to himself “I stand upright in storm. I don’t bend my head in fear every time the wind blows. But these reeds are really so weak."  
  
  
That very night blew a storm and the mighty oak tree was uprooted.  
  
  
“Thank god!" sighed the reeds, “Our way is better. We bend but we don’t break."  
  
One day a peacock met a crane and said, “So sorry for you. You have so dull feathers. Look at the fine colours of my feathers."  
  
  
“Well!’ replied the crane, “your look are brighter then mine. But whereas I can fly high up into the sky. All you can do is to strut about on the ground."  
  
  
Moral : Never Find Fault With Others.  
  
Once The Sun and The Wind happened to have a quarrel. Both of them claimed to be stronger. At last they agreed to have a trial of strength.  
  
  
  
"Here comes a traveller. Let us see who can strip him of his cloak?" said the Sun.  
  
  
  
The Wind agreed and did choose to have the first turn.  
  
  
  
He blew in the hardest possible way.  
  
  
  
As a result, the traveller wrapped his cloak even more tightly around him.  
  
  
  
Then it was the turn of the Sun. At first he shone very gently. The sun went on shining brighter and brighter. The traveller felt hot.  
  
  
  
Before long he took off his cloak and put it in his bag.  
  
  
  
The Wind accepted his defeat.  
  
  
Moral : Fury or force cuts no ice where gentleness does the job.  
  
There were two goats.  
  
Over a river there was a very narrow bridge.  
  
One day a goat was crossing this bridge.  
  
Just at the middle of the bridge he met another goat.  
  
There was no room for them to pass.  
  
"Go back," said one goat to the other, "There is no room for both of us".  
  
"Why should I go back?" said the other goat. "Better you must go back."  
  
“You must go back", said the first goat, "because I am stronger than you."  
  
"You are not stronger than I", said the second goat.  
  
"We will see about that", said the first goat and he put down his horns to fight.  
  
"Stop!" said the second goat.  
  
“If we fight, we shall both fall into the river and be drowned and instead I have a plan. I shall lie down and you may walk over me."  
  
Then the wise one laid down on the bridge and the other goat walked highly over him.  
  
So they crossed the bridge comfortably and went on their ways.  
  
This is a short story to teach you that you can not please everyone. A man and his son were once going with their Donkey to market. As they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said : "You fool, what a Donkey for but to ride is upon?"  
  
  
  
So the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men. One of whom said : "See that lazy youngster. He lets his father walk while he rides."  
  
  
  
So the Man ordered his Boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women. One of whom said to the other : "Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along."  
  
  
  
Well the Man did not know what to do. But at last he took his Boy up before him on the Donkey. By this time they had come to the town and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said :  
  
  
  
"Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor Donkey of yours - you and your hulking son?"  
  
  
  
The man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the Donkey's feet to it and raised the pole and the Donkey to their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge and his fore-feet being tied together, he was drowned.  
  
  
  
"That will teach you," said an old man who had followed them :  
  
  
  
Moral : You Can Not Please Everyone.  
  
  
"Alas," said the mouse, "the whole world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must run into."  
  
     "You only need to change your direction," said the cat, and ate it up.
